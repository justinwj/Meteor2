<h2>The picture Element</h2>

<picture>
    <source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_food.jpg">
    <source media="(min-width: 650px)" srcset="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_car.jpg">
    <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_girl.jpg" style="width:auto;">
</picture>

<p>Resize the browser to see different versions of the picture loading at different viewport sizes.
    The browser looks for the first source element where the media query matches the user's current viewport width,
    and fetches the image specified in the srcset attribute.
</p>

<p>The img element is required as the last child tag of the picture declaration block.
    The img element is used to provide backward compatibility for browsers that do not support the picture element, or if none of the source tags matched.
</p>

<h2>When to use the Picture Element</h2>
    There are two main purposes for the <picture> element:
    <h3>1. Bandwidth</h3>
    If you have a small screen or device, it is not necessary to load a large image file. The browser will use the first <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any of the following elements.
    <h3>2. Format Support</h3>
    Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the <picture> element, you can add images of all formats, and the browser will use the first format it recognizes, and ignore any of the following elements.

</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The picture element is not supported in IE12 and earlier or Safari 9.0 and earlier.</p>
