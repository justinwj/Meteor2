    The First Book of Samuel, Chapters three through twenty:

    3
    1 The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before
    Eli. Yahweh’s word was rare in those days. There
    were not many visions, then. 2 At that time, when
    Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had
    begun to grow dim, so that he could not see), 3 and
    God’s lamp hadn’t yet gone out, and Samuel had
    laid down in Yahweh’s temple where God’s ark was,
    4 Yahweh called Samuel. He said, “Here I am.”
    5He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; for you called
    me.”
    He said, “I didn’t call. Lie down again.”
    He went and lay down. 6Yahweh called yet again,
    “Samuel!”
    Samuel arose and wentto Eli and said, “Here I am;
    for you called me.”
    He answered, “I didn’t call, my son. Lie down
    again.” 7 Now Samuel didn’t yet know Yahweh,
    neither was Yahweh’s word yet revealed to him.
    8 Yahweh called Samuel again the third time. He
    arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; for you
    called me.”
    Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.
    9 Therefore Elisaid to Samuel, “Go, lie down. Itshall
    be, if he calls you, that you shall say, ‘Speak, Yahweh; for your servant hears.’ ” So Samuel went and
    lay down in his place. 10 Yahweh came, and stood,
    and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!”
    Then Samuel said, “Speak; for your servant
    hears.”
    † 2:20 or, seed ‡ 2:31 “Behold”, from “הֵנִּ ͏ה ,“means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.
    § 2:33 or, blind your eyes with tears
    1 Samuel 3:11 181 1 Samuel 5:6
    11 Yahweh said to Samuel, “Behold, I will do a
    thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone
    who hears it will tingle. 12 In that day I will perform
    against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his
    house, from the beginning even to the end. 13 For
    I have told him that I will judge his house forever
    for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons
    brought a curse on themselves, and he didn’t restrain them. 14 Therefore I have sworn to the house
    of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be
    removed with sacrifice or offering forever.”
    15 Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the
    doors of Yahweh’s house. Samuel was afraid to show
    Eli the vision. 16 Then Eli called Samuel and said,
    “Samuel, my son!”
    He said, “Here I am.”
    17 He said, “What is the thing that he has spoken
    to you? Please don’t hide it from me. God do so to
    you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of
    all the things that he spoke to you.”
    18 Samuel told him every bit, and hid nothing
    from him.
    He said, “It is Yahweh. Let him do what seems
    good to him.”
    19 Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him and let
    none of his words fall to the ground. 20 All Israel
    from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
    established to be a prophet of Yahweh. 21 Yahweh
    appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed
    himself to Samuel in Shiloh by Yahweh’s word.
    4
    1 The word of Samuel came to all Israel.
    Now Israel went out against the Philistines to
    battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer; and the
    Philistines encamped in Aphek. 2 The Philistines
    put themselves in array against Israel. When they
    joined battle, Israel was defeated by the Philistines,
    who killed about four thousand men of the army
    in the field. 3 When the people had come into the
    camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has Yahweh
    defeated us today before the Philistines? Let’s get
    the ark of Yahweh’s covenant out of Shiloh and
    bring it to us, that it may come among us and save
    us out of the hand of our enemies.”
    4 So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought
    from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh
    of Armies, who sits above the cherubim; and the
    two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there
    with the ark of the covenant of God. 5 When the
    ark of Yahweh’s covenant came into the camp, all
    Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth
    resounded. 6 When the Philistines heard the noise
    of the shout, they said, “What does the noise of
    this greatshout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?”
    They understood that Yahweh’s ark had come into
    the camp. 7 The Philistines were afraid, for they
    said, “God has come into the camp.” They said,
    “Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing
    before. 8 Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of
    the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods
    that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues
    in the wilderness. 9 Be strong and behave like men,
    O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the
    Hebrews, as they have been to you. Strengthen
    yourselves like men, and fight!” 10 The Philistines
    fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled
    to his tent. There was a very great slaughter; for
    thirty thousand footmen of Israel fell. 11 God’s ark
    was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and
    Phinehas, were slain.
    12 A man of Benjamin ran out of the army and
    came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn
    and with dirt on his head. 13When he came, behold,
    Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching, for
    his heart trembled for God’s ark. When the man
    came into the city and told aboutit, allthe city cried
    out. 14 When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he
    said, “What does the noise of this tumult mean?”
    The man hurried, and came and told Eli. 15 Now
    Eli was ninety-eight years old. His eyes were set, so
    that he could not see. 16 The man said to Eli, “I am
    he who came out of the army, and I fled today out
    of the army.”
    He said, “How did the matter go, my son?”
    17He who broughtthe news answered, “Israel has
    fled before the Philistines, and there has been also
    a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons
    also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and God’s ark
    has been captured.”
    18 When he made mention of God’s ark, Eli fell
    from off his seat backward by the side of the gate;
    and his neck broke, and he died, for he was an old
    man and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.
    19 His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with
    child, near to giving birth. When she heard the
    news that God’s ark was taken and that her fatherin-law and her husband were dead, she bowed
    herself and gave birth; for her pains came on her.
    20 About the time of her death the women who
    stood by her said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for you
    have given birth to a son.” But she didn’t answer,
    neither did she regard it. 21 She named the child
    Ichabod,* saying, “The glory has departed from
    Israel!” because God’s ark was taken, and because
    of her father-in-law and her husband. 22 She said,
    “The glory has departed from Israel; for God’s ark
    has been taken.”
    5
    1 Now the Philistines had taken God’s ark, and
    they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 2 The
    Philistines took God’s ark, and brought it into the
    house of Dagon and set it by Dagon. 3 When the
    people of Ashdod arose early on the next day,
    behold, Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground
    before Yahweh’s ark. They took Dagon and set him
    in his place again. 4 When they arose early on
    the following morning, behold, Dagon had fallen
    on his face to the ground before Yahweh’s ark;
    and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his
    hands were cut off on the threshold. Only Dagon’s
    torso was intact. 5 Therefore neither the priests of
    Dagon nor any who come into Dagon’s house step
    on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.
    6 But Yahweh’s hand was heavy on the people of
    * 4:21 “Ichabod” means “no glory”.
    1 Samuel 5:7 182 1 Samuel 7:6
    Ashdod, and he destroyed them and struck them
    with tumors, even Ashdod and its borders.
    7When the men of Ashdod saw thatit wasso,they
    said, “The ark of the God of Israelshall notstay with
    us, for his hand is severe on us and on Dagon our
    god.” 8 They sent therefore and gathered together
    all the lords of the Philistines, and said, “What shall
    we do with the ark of the God of Israel?”
    They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel
    be carried over to Gath.” They carried the ark of
    the God of Israel there. 9 It was so, that after they
    had carried it there, Yahweh’s hand was against the
    city with a very great confusion; and he struck the
    men ofthe city, both small and great,so thattumors
    broke out on them. 10 So they sent God’s ark to
    Ekron.
    As God’s ark came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried
    out, saying, “They have brought the ark of the God
    of Israel here to us, to kill us and our people.”
    11 They sent therefore and gathered together all the
    lords of the Philistines, and they said, “Send the ark
    of the God of Israel away, and let it go again to its
    own place, that it not kill us and our people.” For
    there was a deadly panic throughout all the city.
    The hand of God was very heavy there. 12 The men
    who didn’t die were struck with the tumors; and the
    cry of the city went up to heaven.
    6
    1 Yahweh’s ark was in the country of the
    Philistines seven months. 2 The Philistines called
    for the priests and the diviners, saying, “What shall
    we do with Yahweh’s ark? Show us how we should
    send it to its place.”
    3They said, “If you send away the ark ofthe God of
    Israel, don’t send it empty; but by all means return
    a trespass offering to him. Then you will be healed,
    and it will be known to you why his hand is not
    removed from you.”
    4Then they said, “Whatshould the trespass offering be which we shall return to him?”
    They said, “Five golden tumors and five golden
    mice, for the number of the lords of the Philistines;
    for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.
    5 Therefore you shall make images of your tumors
    and images of your mice that mar the land; and
    you shall give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps
    he will release his hand from you, from your gods,
    and from your land. 6 Why then do you harden
    your hearts asthe Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened
    their hearts? When he had worked wonderfully
    among them, didn’t they let the people go, and they
    departed?
    7 “Now therefore take and prepare yourselves a
    new cart and two milk cows on which there has
    come no yoke; and tie the cowsto the cart, and bring
    their calves home from them; 8 and take Yahweh’s
    ark and lay it on the cart. Put the jewels of gold,
    which you return him for a trespass offering, in a
    box by its side; and send it away, that it may go.
    9Behold, if it goes up by the way of its own borderto
    Beth Shemesh, then he has done us this great evil;
    but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand
    thatstruck us. It was a chance that happened to us.”
    10 The men did so, and took two milk cows and
    tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at
    home. 11 They put Yahweh’s ark on the cart, and
    the box with the golden mice and the images of
    their tumors. 12 The cows took the straight way
    by the way to Beth Shemesh. They went along the
    highway, lowing as they went, and didn’t turn away
    to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of
    the Philistines went after them to the border of
    Beth Shemesh. 13 The people of Beth Shemesh were
    reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they
    lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced
    to see it. 14 The cart came into the field of Joshua
    of Beth Shemesh, and stood there, where there was
    a great stone. Then they split the wood of the
    cart and offered up the cows for a burnt offering
    to Yahweh. 15 The Levites took down Yahweh’s ark
    and the box that was with it, in which the jewels of
    gold were, and put them on the great stone; and
    the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings
    and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh.
    16 When the five lords of the Philistines had seen it,
    they returned to Ekron the same day. 17 These are
    the golden tumors which the Philistines returned
    for a trespass offering to Yahweh: for Ashdod one,
    for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for
    Ekron one; 18 and the golden mice, according to the
    number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging
    to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of
    country villages, even to the great stone on which
    they set down Yahweh’s ark. That stone remains
    to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.
    19 He struck of the men of Beth Shemesh, because
    they had looked into Yahweh’s ark, he struck fifty
    thousand seventy of the men. Then the people
    mourned, because Yahweh had struck the people
    with a great slaughter. 20 The men of Beth Shemesh
    said, “Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy
    God? To whom shall he go up from us?”
    21 They sent messengers to the inhabitants
    of Kiriath Jearim, saying, “The Philistines have
    brought back Yahweh’s ark. Come down and bring
    it up to yourselves.”
    7
    1 The men of Kiriath Jearim came and took Yahweh’s ark, and brought it into Abinadab’s house on
    the hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son to keep
    Yahweh’s ark. 2 From the day that the ark stayed
    in Kiriath Jearim, the time was long —for it was
    twenty years; and all the house of Israel lamented
    after Yahweh. 3 Samuel spoke to all the house of
    Israel, saying, “If you are returning to Yahweh with
    all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and
    the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your
    hearts to Yahweh, and serve him only; and he will
    deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.”
    4 Then the children of Israel removed the Baals and
    the Ashtaroth, and served Yahweh only. 5 Samuel
    said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray
    to Yahweh for you.” 6 They gathered together to
    Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before
    Yahweh, and fasted on that day, and said there, “We
    1 Samuel 7:7 183 1 Samuel 9:7
    have sinned against Yahweh.” Samuel judged the
    children of Israel in Mizpah.
    7 When the Philistines heard that the children of
    Israel were gathered together at Mizpah, the lords
    of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the
    children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the
    Philistines. 8 The children of Israel said to Samuel,
    “Don’t stop crying to Yahweh our God for us, that
    he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.”
    9 Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered it for
    a whole burnt offering to Yahweh. Samuel cried
    to Yahweh for Israel, and Yahweh answered him.
    10 As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the
    Philistines came near to battle against Israel; but
    Yahweh thundered with a great thunder on that
    day on the Philistines and confused them; and they
    were struck down before Israel. 11 The men of Israel
    went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and
    struck them until they came under Beth Kar.
    12 Then Samuel took a stone and set it between
    Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer,*
    saying, “Yahweh helped us until now.” 13 So the
    Philistines were subdued, and they stopped coming
    within the border of Israel. Yahweh’s hand was
    against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
    14 The cities which the Philistines had taken from
    Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to
    Gath; and Israelrecovered its border out ofthe hand
    of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel
    and the Amorites.
    15 Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
    16 He went from year to year in a circuit to Bethel,
    Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those
    places. 17 His return was to Ramah, for his house
    was there, and he judged Israel there; and he built
    an altar to Yahweh there.
    8
    1 When Samuel was old, he made his sons judges
    over Israel. 2 Now the name of his firstborn was
    Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah. They were
    judges in Beersheba. 3 His sons didn’t walk in his
    ways, but turned away after dishonest gain, took
    bribes, and perverted justice.
    4Then allthe elders of Israel gathered themselves
    together and came to Samuel to Ramah. 5 They said
    to him, “Behold, you are old, and your sons don’t
    walk in your ways. Now make us a king to judge
    us like all the nations.” 6 But the thing displeased
    Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.”
    Samuel prayed to Yahweh. 7 Yahweh said to
    Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all
    that they tell you; for they have not rejected you,
    but they have rejected me as the king over them.
    8 According to all the works which they have done
    since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt
    even to this day, in that they have forsaken me and
    served other gods, so they also do to you. 9 Now
    therefore, listen to their voice. However, you shall
    protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the
    way of the king who will reign over them.”
    10 Samuel told all Yahweh’s words to the people
    who asked him for a king. 11 He said, “This will be
    the way of the king who shallreign over you: he will
    take yoursons and appoint them as hisservants, for
    his chariots and to be his horsemen; and they will
    run before his chariots. 12 He will appoint them to
    him for captains ofthousands and captains of fifties;
    and he will assign some to plow his ground and to
    reap his harvest; and to make his instruments of
    war and the instruments of his chariots. 13 He will
    take your daughters to be perfumers, to be cooks,
    and to be bakers. 14 He will take your fields, your
    vineyards, and your olive groves, even your best,
    and give them to his servants. 15 He will take one
    tenth of your seed and of your vineyards, and give
    it to his officers and to his servants. 16 He will take
    your male servants, yourfemale servants, your best
    young men, and your donkeys, and assign them to
    his own work. 17 He will take one tenth of your
    flocks; and you will be his servants. 18 You will cry
    out in that day because of your king whom you will
    have chosen for yourselves; and Yahweh will not
    answer you in that day.”
    19 But the people refused to listen to the voice of
    Samuel; and they said, “No, but we will have a king
    over us, 20 that we also may be like all the nations;
    and that our king may judge us, and go out before
    us, and fight our battles.”
    21 Samuel heard all the words of the people, and
    he rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh. 22Yahweh
    said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice, and make
    them a king.”
    Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Everyone go to
    your own city.”
    9
    1Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name
    was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of
    Becorath, the son of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite,
    a mighty man of valor. 2 He had a son whose name
    was Saul, an impressive young man; and there was
    not among the children of Israel a more handsome
    person than he. From his shoulders and upward he
    was taller than any of the people.
    3 The donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost.
    Kish said to Saul his son, “Now take one of the servants with you, and arise, go look for the donkeys.”
    4 He passed through the hill country of Ephraim,
    and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they
    didn’t find them. Then they passed through the
    land of Shaalim, and they weren’t there. Then he
    passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they
    didn’t find them.
    5 When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul
    said to his servant who was with him, “Come! Let’s
    return, lest my fatherstop caring aboutthe donkeys
    and be anxious for us.”
    6 The servant said to him, “Behold now, there is a
    man of God in this city, and he is a man who is held
    in honor. All that he says surely happens. Now let’s
    go there. Perhaps he can tell us which way to go.”
    7 Then Saul said to his servant, “But behold, if we
    go, what should we bring the man? For the bread
    is spent in our sacks, and there is not a present to
    bring to the man of God. What do we have?”
    * 7:12 “Ebenezer” means “stone of help”.
    1 Samuel 9:8 184 1 Samuel 10:14
    8 The servant answered Saul again and said, “Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel*
    of silver. I will give that to the man of God, to tell us
    our way.” 9 (In earlier times in Israel, when a man
    went to inquire of God, he said, “Come! Let’s go to
    the seer;” for he who is now called a prophet was
    before called a seer.)
    10Then Saulsaid to hisservant, “Wellsaid. Come!
    Let’s go.” So they went to the city where the man of
    God was. 11 As they went up the ascent to the city,
    they found young maidens going out to draw water,
    and said to them, “Is the seer here?”
    12 They answered them and said, “He is. Behold,
    he is before you. Hurry now, for he has come today
    into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today
    in the high place. 13 As soon as you have come
    into the city, you will immediately find him before
    he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people
    will not eat until he comes, because he blesses the
    sacrifice. Afterwards those who are invited eat.
    Now therefore go up; for at this time you will find
    him.”
    14 They went up to the city. As they came within
    the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them to
    go up to the high place.
    15 Now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day
    before Saul came, saying, 16 “Tomorrow about this
    time I will send you a man out of the land of
    Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince
    over my people Israel. He willsave my people out of
    the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon
    my people, because their cry has come to me.”
    17 When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him,
    “Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! He will
    have authority over my people.”
    18 Then Saul approached Samuel in the gateway,
    and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.”
    19 Samuel answered Saul and said, “I am the seer.
    Go up before me to the high place, for you are to
    eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go
    and will tell you all that is in your heart. 20 As for
    your donkeys who were lost three days ago, don’t
    set your mind on them, for they have been found.
    For whom does all Israel desire? Is it not you and all
    your father’s house?”
    21 Saul answered, “Am I not a Benjamite, of the
    smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family the
    least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?
    Why then do you speak to me like this?”
    22 Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought
    them into the guestroom, and made them sit in the
    best place among those who were invited, who were
    about thirty persons. 23 Samuel said to the cook,
    “Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said
    to you, ‘Set it aside.’ ” 24 The cook took up the thigh,
    and that which was on it, and set it before Saul.
    Samuelsaid, “Behold,that which has been reserved!
    Set it before yourself and eat; because it has been
    keptfor you forthe appointed time, forIsaid, ‘I have
    invited the people.’ ” So Saul ate with Samuel that
    day.
    25When they had come down from the high place
    into the city, he talked with Saul on the housetop.
    26 They arose early; and about daybreak, Samuel
    called to Saul on the housetop, saying, “Get up, that
    I may send you away.” Saul arose, and they both
    went outside, he and Samuel, together. 27 As they
    were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said
    to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us.” He
    went ahead, then Samuel said, “But stand still first,
    that I may cause you to hear God’s message.”
    10
    1Then Samueltook the vial of oil and poured it on
    his head, then kissed him and said, “Hasn’t Yahweh
    anointed you to be prince over his inheritance?
    2 When you have departed from me today, then you
    will find two men by Rachel’stomb, on the border of
    Benjamin at Zelzah. They willtell you, ‘The donkeys
    which you went to look for have been found; and
    behold, your father has stopped caring about the
    donkeys and is anxious for you, saying, “What shall
    I do for my son?” ’
    3 “Then you will go on forward from there, and
    you will come to the oak of Tabor. Three men will
    meet you there going up to God to Bethel: one carrying three young goats, and another carrying three
    loaves of bread, and another carrying a container of
    wine. 4 They will greet you and give you two loaves
    of bread, which you shall receive from their hand.
    5 “After that you will come to the hill of God,
    where the garrison of the Philistines is; and it will
    happen, when you have come there to the city,
    that you will meet a band of prophets coming down
    from the high place with a lute, a tambourine, a
    pipe, and a harp before them; and they will be
    prophesying. 6 Then Yahweh’s Spirit will come
    mightily on you, then you will prophesy with them
    and will be turned into another man. 7 Let it be,
    when these signs have come to you, that you do
    what is appropriate forthe occasion; for God is with
    you.
    8 “Go down ahead of me to Gilgal; and behold,
    I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings
    and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings. Wait
    seven days, until I come to you and show you what
    you are to do.” 9 It was so, that when he had
    turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him
    another heart; and all those signs happened that
    day. 10 When they came there to the hill, behold,
    a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God
    came mightily on him, and he prophesied among
    them. 11 When all who knew him before saw that,
    behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the
    people said to one another, “What is this that has
    come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the
    prophets?”
    12 One from the same place answered, “Who is
    their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, “Is
    Saul also among the prophets?” 13 When he had
    finished prophesying, he came to the high place.
    14 Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant,
    “Where did you go?”
    * 9:8 A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, so 1/4 shekel would be a small coin of about 2.5 grams.
    1 Samuel 10:15 185 1 Samuel 12:8
    He said, “To seek the donkeys. When we saw that
    they were not found, we came to Samuel.”
    15 Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me what Samuel
    said to you.”
    16 Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly
    that the donkeys were found.” But concerning the
    matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he
    didn’t tell him.
    17 Samuel called the people together to Yahweh
    to Mizpah; 18 and he said to the children of Israel,
    “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says ‘I brought Israel up
    out of Egypt and I delivered you out of the hand
    of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the
    kingdoms that oppressed you.’ 19 But you have
    today rejected your God, who himself saves you
    out of all your calamities and your distresses; and
    you have said to him, ‘No! Set a king over us!’
    Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh
    by your tribes and by your thousands.”
    20 So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near,
    and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen. 21He brought
    the tribe of Benjamin near by their families and the
    family of the Matrites was chosen. Then Saul the
    son of Kish was chosen; but when they looked for
    him, he could not be found. 22 Therefore they asked
    of Yahweh further, “Is there yet a man to come
    here?”
    Yahweh answered, “Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.”
    23 They ran and got him there. When he stood
    among the people, he was higher than any of the
    people from his shoulders and upward. 24 Samuel
    said to all the people, “Do you see him whom
    Yahweh has chosen, that there is no one like him
    among all the people?”
    All the people shouted and said, “Long live the
    king!”
    25 Then Samuel told the people the regulations
    of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book and laid
    it up before Yahweh. Samuel sent all the people
    away, every man to his house. 26 Saul also went
    to his house in Gibeah; and the army went with
    him, whose hearts God had touched. 27 But certain
    worthless fellows said, “How could this man save
    us?” They despised him, and brought him no
    tribute. But he held his peace.
    11
    1 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up and encamped against Jabesh Gilead; and all the men of
    Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a covenant with us,
    and we will serve you.”
    2 Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this
    condition I will make it with you, that all your right
    eyes be gouged out. I will make this dishonor all
    Israel.”
    3 The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us
    seven days, that we may send messengers to all the
    borders of Israel; and then, if there is no one to save
    us, we will come out to you.” 4Then the messengers
    came to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these wordsin the
    ears of the people, then all the people lifted up their
    voice and wept.
    5 Behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the
    field; and Saul said, “What ails the people that they
    weep?” They told him the words of the men of
    Jabesh. 6God’s Spirit came mightily on Saul when he
    heard those words, and his anger burned hot. 7 He
    took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, then
    sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by
    the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever doesn’t
    come out after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be
    done to his oxen.” The dread of Yahweh fell on
    the people, and they came out as one man. 8 He
    counted them in Bezek; and the children of Israel
    were three hundred thousand, and the men ofJudah
    thirty thousand. 9 They said to the messengers who
    came, “Tell the men of Jabesh Gilead, ‘Tomorrow, by
    the time the sun is hot, you will be rescued.’ ” The
    messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and
    they were glad. 10 Therefore the men of Jabesh said,
    “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall
    do with us all that seems good to you.” 11 On the
    next day, Saul put the people in three companies;
    and they came into the middle of the camp in the
    morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until
    the heat of the day. Those who remained were
    scattered,so that no two of them were left together.
    12The people said to Samuel, “Who is he who said,
    ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring those men, that we
    may put them to death!”
    13 Saul said, “No man shall be put to death today;
    for today Yahweh has rescued Israel.”
    14 Then Samuel said to the people, “Come! Let’s
    go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.” 15 All
    the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul
    king before Yahweh in Gilgal. There they offered
    sacrifices of peace offerings before Yahweh; and
    there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
    12
    1 Samuelsaid to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened
    to your voice in all that you said to me, and have
    made a king over you. 2Now, behold, the king walks
    before you. I am old and gray-headed. Behold, my
    sons are with you. I have walked before you from my
    youth to this day. 3 Here I am. Witness against me
    before Yahweh and before his anointed. Whose ox
    have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom
    have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Of
    whose hand have I taken a bribe to make me blind
    my eyes? I will restore it to you.”
    4 They said, “You have not defrauded us, nor
    oppressed us, neither have you taken anything from
    anyone’s hand.”
    5He said to them, “Yahweh is witness against you,
    and his anointed is witness today, that you have not
    found anything in my hand.”
    They said, “He is witness.” 6 Samuel said to the
    people, “It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and
    Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the
    land of Egypt. 7Now therefore stand still, that I may
    plead with you before Yahweh concerning all the
    righteous acts of Yahweh, which he did to you and
    to your fathers.
    8 “When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your
    fathers cried to Yahweh, then Yahweh sent Moses
    1 Samuel 12:9 186 1 Samuel 13:19
    and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt,
    and made them to dwell in this place. 9 But they
    forgot Yahweh their God; and he sold them into
    the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor,
    and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the
    hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against
    them. 10 They cried to Yahweh, and said, ‘We have
    sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh and have
    served the Baals and the Ashtaroth; but now deliver
    us out of the hand of our enemies, and we willserve
    you.’ 11 Yahweh sent Jerubbaal, Bedan, Jephthah,
    and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of
    your enemies on every side; and you lived in safety.
    12 “When you saw that Nahash the king of the
    children of Ammon came against you, you said
    to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us,’ when
    Yahweh your God was your king. 13 Now therefore
    see the king whom you have chosen and whom
    you have asked for. Behold, Yahweh has set a
    king over you. 14 If you will fear Yahweh, and
    serve him, and listen to his voice, and not rebel
    against the commandment of Yahweh, then both
    you and also the king who reigns over you are
    followers of Yahweh your God. 15 But if you will
    not listen to Yahweh’s voice, but rebel against the
    commandment of Yahweh, then Yahweh’s hand will
    be against you, as it was against your fathers.
    16 “Now therefore stand still and see this great
    thing, which Yahweh will do before your eyes.
    17 Isn’t it wheat harvest today? I will call to Yahweh,
    that he may send thunder and rain; and you will
    know and see that your wickedness is great, which
    you have done in Yahweh’s sight, in asking for a
    king.”
    18 So Samuel called to Yahweh, and Yahweh sent
    thunder and rain that day. Then all the people
    greatly feared Yahweh and Samuel.
    19 All the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your
    servants to Yahweh your God, that we not die; for
    we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask for a
    king.”
    20 Samuelsaid to the people, “Don’t be afraid. You
    have indeed done all this evil; yet don’t turn away
    from following Yahweh, but serve Yahweh with all
    your heart. 21Don’tturn away to go after vain things
    which can’t profit or deliver, forthey are vain. 22 For
    Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great
    name’ssake, because it has pleased Yahweh to make
    you a people for himself. 23 Moreover, as for me, far
    be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in
    ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the
    good and the right way. 24 Only fear Yahweh, and
    serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider
    what great things he has done for you. 25 But if you
    keep doing evil, you will be consumed, both you and
    your king.”
    13
    1 Saul was thirty years old when he became king,
    and he reigned over Israel forty-two years.*
    2 Saul chose for himself three thousand men of
    Israel, of which two thousand were with Saul in
    Michmash and in the Mount of Bethel, and one
    thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. He sent the rest of the people to their
    own tents. 3 Jonathan struck the garrison of the
    Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines
    heard of it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout all
    the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!” 4 All
    Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of
    the Philistines, and also that Israel was considered
    an abomination to the Philistines. The people
    were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal. 5 The
    Philistines assembled themselves together to fight
    with Israel: thirty thousand chariots, six thousand
    horsemen, and people as the sand which is on
    the seashore in multitude. They came up and
    encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven.
    6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in
    trouble (for the people were distressed), then the
    people hid themselvesin caves, in thickets, in rocks,
    in tombs, and in pits. 7 Now some of the Hebrews
    had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and
    Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and
    all the people followed him trembling. 8 He stayed
    seven days, according to the time set by Samuel; but
    Samuel didn’t come to Gilgal, and the people were
    scattering from him. 9 Saul said, “Bring the burnt
    offering to me here, and the peace offerings.” He
    offered the burnt offering.
    10 It came to pass that as soon as he had finished
    offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came;
    and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet
    him. 11 Samuel said, “What have you done?”
    Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were
    scattered from me, and that you didn’t come within
    the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash, 12 therefore
    Isaid, ‘Now the Philistines will come down on me to
    Gilgal, and I haven’t entreated the favor of Yahweh.’
    I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt
    offering.”
    13 Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly.
    You have not kept the commandment of Yahweh
    your God, which he commanded you; for now Yahweh would have established your kingdom on Israel
    forever. 14 But now your kingdom will not continue.
    Yahweh has sought for himself a man after his own
    heart, and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince
    over his people, because you have not kept that
    which Yahweh commanded you.”
    15 Samuel arose, and went from Gilgal to Gibeah
    of Benjamin. Saul counted the people who were
    present with him, about six hundred men. 16 Saul,
    and Jonathan his son, and the people who were
    present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin;
    but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. 17 The
    raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines
    in three companies: one company turned to the
    way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;
    18 another company turned the way to Beth Horon;
    and another company turned the way of the border
    that looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the
    wilderness. 19 Now there was no blacksmith found
    * 13:1 The traditional Hebrew text omits “thirty” and “forty-”. The blanks are filled in here from a few manuscripts of the Septuagint.
    1 Samuel 13:20 187 1 Samuel 14:33
    throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines
    said, “Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or
    spears”; 20 but all the Israelites went down to the
    Philistines, each man to sharpen his own plowshare,
    mattock, ax, and sickle. 21The price was one payim†
    each to sharpen mattocks, plowshares, pitchforks,
    axes, and goads. 22 So it came to pass in the day of
    battle that neithersword norspear wasfound in the
    hand of any of the people who were with Saul and
    Jonathan; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them.
    23 The garrison of the Philistines went out to the
    pass of Michmash.
    14
    1Now it happened on a day that Jonathan the son
    of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor,
    “Come! Let’s go overto the Philistines’ garrison that
    is on the other side.” But he didn’t tell his father.
    2 Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under
    the pomegranate tree which is in Migron; and the
    people who were with him were about six hundred
    men, 3 including Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s
    brother,the son of Phinehas,the son of Elithe priest
    of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. The people
    didn’t know that Jonathan was gone.
    4 Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought
    to go over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a
    rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the
    other side; and the name of the one was Bozez, and
    the name of the other Seneh. 5 The one crag rose up
    on the north in front of Michmash, and the other
    on the south in front of Geba. 6 Jonathan said to
    the young man who bore his armor, “Come! Let’s
    go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It
    may be that Yahweh will work for us, forthere is no
    restraint on Yahweh to save by many or by few.”
    7 His armor bearer said to him, “Do all that is in
    your heart. Go, and behold, I am with you according
    to your heart.”
    8 Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will pass over
    to the men, and we will reveal ourselves to them.
    9 If they say this to us, ‘Wait until we come to you!’
    then we will stand still in our place and will not go
    up to them. 10 But if they say this, ‘Come up to us!’
    then we will go up, for Yahweh has delivered them
    into our hand. This shall be the sign to us.”
    11 Both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said,
    “Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes
    where they had hidden themselves!” 12 The men
    of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor
    bearer, and said, “Come up to us, and we will show
    you something!”
    Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come up after
    me, for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand
    of Israel.” 13 Jonathan climbed up on his hands
    and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him,
    and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer
    killed them after him. 14 That first slaughter, which
    Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about
    twenty men, within asit were half a furrow’slength
    in an acre of land.
    15 There was a trembling in the camp, in the
    field, and among all the people; the garrison and
    the raiders also trembled; and the earth quaked, so
    there was an exceedingly great trembling. 16 The
    watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and
    behold, the multitude melted away and scattered.
    17 Then Saul said to the people who were with him,
    “Count now, and see who is missing from us.” When
    they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor
    bearer were not there.
    18 Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring God’s ark here.” For
    God’s ark was with the children of Israel at that
    time. 19 While Saul talked to the priest, the tumult
    that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and
    increased; and Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw
    your hand!”
    20 Saul and all the people who were with him
    were gathered together, and came to the battle; and
    behold, they were all striking each other with their
    swordsin very great confusion. 21Now the Hebrews
    who were with the Philistines before and who went
    up with them into the camp from all around, even
    they also turned to be with the Israelites who were
    with Saul and Jonathan. 22 Likewise all the men
    of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill
    country of Ephraim, when they heard that the
    Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after
    them in the battle. 23 So Yahweh saved Israel that
    day; and the battle passed over by Beth Aven.
    24 The men of Israel were distressed that day; for
    Saul had adjured the people, saying, “Cursed is the
    man who eats any food until it is evening, and I am
    avenged of my enemies.” So none of the people
    tasted food.
    25 All the people came into the forest; and there
    was honey on the ground. 26 When the people had
    come to the forest, behold, honey was dripping, but
    no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people
    feared the oath. 27 But Jonathan didn’t hear when
    his father commanded the people with the oath.
    Therefore he put out the end of the rod that was
    in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb, and
    put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened.
    28 Then one of the people answered, and said, “Your
    father directly commanded the people with an oath,
    saying, ‘Cursed isthe man who eatsfood today.’ ” So
    the people were faint.
    29 Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled
    the land. Please look how my eyes have brightened
    because I tasted a little of this honey. 30 How much
    more, if perhaps the people had eaten freely today
    of the plunder of their enemies which they found?
    For now there has been no great slaughter among
    the Philistines.” 31 They struck the Philistines that
    day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were
    very faint; 32 and the people pounced on the plunder, and took sheep, cattle, and calves, and killed
    them on the ground; and the people ate them with
    the blood. 33 Then they told Saul, saying, “Behold,
    the people are sinning against Yahweh, in that they
    eat meat with the blood.”
    † 13:21 A payim (or pim) was 2/3 shekel of silver, or 0.26 ounces, or 7.6 grams
    1 Samuel 14:34 188 1 Samuel 15:18
    He said, “You have dealt treacherously. Roll a
    large stone to me today!” 34 Saul said, “Disperse
    yourselves among the people, and tell them, ‘Every
    man bring me here his ox, and every man hissheep,
    and kill them here, and eat; and don’t sin against
    Yahweh in eating meat with the blood.’ ” All the
    people brought every man his ox with him that
    night, and killed them there.
    35 Saul built an altarto Yahweh. This wasthe first
    altar that he built to Yahweh. 36 Saul said, “Let’s
    go down after the Philistines by night, and take
    plunder among them until the morning light. Let’s
    not leave a man of them.”
    They said, “Do whatever seems good to you.”
    Then the priest said, “Let’s draw near here to
    God.”
    37 Saul asked counsel of God: “Shall I go down
    after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into
    the hand of Israel?” But he didn’t answer him that
    day. 38 Saul said, “Draw near here, all you chiefs of
    the people, and know and see in whom this sin has
    been today. 39 For as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel,
    though it isin Jonathan my son, he shallsurely die.”
    But there was not a man among all the people who
    answered him. 40 Then he said to all Israel, “You be
    on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on
    the other side.”
    The people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to
    you.”
    41 Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of
    Israel, “Show the right.”
    Jonathan and Saul were chosen, but the people
    escaped.
    42 Saul said, “Cast lots between me and Jonathan
    my son.”
    Jonathan was selected.
    43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you
    have done!”
    Jonathan told him, and said, “I certainly did taste
    a little honey with the end of the rod that wasin my
    hand; and behold, I must die.”
    44 Saul said, “God do so and more also; for you
    shall surely die, Jonathan.”
    45 The people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die,
    who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far
    from it! As Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of
    his head fall to the ground, for he has worked with
    God today!” So the people rescued Jonathan, so he
    didn’t die. 46 Then Saul went up from following the
    Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own
    place.
    47 Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over
    Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every
    side: against Moab, and against the children of
    Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings
    of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever
    he turned himself, he defeated them. 48 He did
    valiantly and struck the Amalekites, and delivered
    Israel out of the hands of those who plundered
    them. 49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan,
    Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two
    daughters were these: the name of the firstborn
    Merab, and the name of the younger Michal. 50 The
    name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of
    Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of his army was
    Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle. 51 Kish was the
    father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the
    son of Abiel.
    52 There wassevere war against the Philistines all
    the days of Saul; and when Saulsaw any mighty man
    or any valiant man, he took him into his service.
    15
    1 Samuel said to Saul, “Yahweh sent me to anoint
    you to be king over his people, over Israel. Now
    therefore listen to the voice of Yahweh’s words.
    2 Yahweh of Armies says, ‘I remember what Amalek
    did to Israel, how he set himself against him on
    the way when he came up out of Egypt. 3 Now
    go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that
    they have, and don’t spare them; but kill both man
    and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep,
    camel and donkey.’ ”
    4 Saul summoned the people, and counted them
    in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten
    thousand men of Judah. 5 Saul came to the city of
    Amalek, and set an ambush in the valley. 6 Saul said
    to the Kenites, “Go, depart, go down from among
    the Amalekites, lestI destroy you with them; for you
    showed kindness to all the children of Israel when
    they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed
    from among the Amalekites.
    7 Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you
    go to Shur, which is before Egypt. 8He took Agag the
    king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed
    all the people with the edge of the sword. 9 But
    Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of
    the sheep, of the cattle, of the fat calves, of the
    lambs, and allthat was good, and were not willing to
    utterly destroy them; but everything that was vile
    and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
    10 Then Yahweh’s word came to Samuel, saying,
    11 “It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king,
    for he has turned back from following me, and has
    not performed my commandments.” Samuel was
    angry; and he cried to Yahweh all night.
    12 Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning;
    and Samuel was told, saying, “Saul came to Carmel,
    and behold, he set up a monument for himself,
    turned, passed on, and went down to Gilgal.”
    13 Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him,
    “You are blessed by Yahweh! I have performed the
    commandment of Yahweh.”
    14 Samuel said, “Then what does this bleating of
    the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the cattle
    which I hear mean?”
    15 Saul said, “They have brought them from the
    Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the
    sheep and of the cattle, to sacrifice to Yahweh your
    God. We have utterly destroyed the rest.”
    16 Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stay, and I will tell
    you what Yahweh said to me last night.”
    He said to him, “Say on.”
    17 Samuel said, “Though you were little in your
    own sight, weren’t you made the head of the tribes
    of Israel? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;
    18 and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, ‘Go,
    and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and
    1 Samuel 15:19 189 1 Samuel 16:23
    fight against them until they are consumed.’ 19Why
    then didn’t you obey Yahweh’s voice, but took the
    plunder, and did that which was evil in Yahweh’s
    sight?”
    20 Saul said to Samuel, “But I have obeyed Yahweh’s voice, and have gone the way which Yahweh
    sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek,
    and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. 21 But
    the people took ofthe plunder,sheep and cattle, the
    best of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh
    your God in Gilgal.”
    22 Samuel said, “Has Yahweh as great delight in
    burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying Yahweh’s voice? Behold,to obey is betterthan sacrifice,
    and to listen than the fat of rams. 23 For rebellion
    is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as
    idolatry and teraphim.* Because you have rejected
    Yahweh’s word, he has also rejected you from being
    king.”
    24 Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; for I have
    transgressed the commandment of Yahweh and
    your words, because I feared the people and obeyed
    their voice. 25 Now therefore, please pardon my
    sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship
    Yahweh.”
    26 Samuelsaid to Saul, “I will notreturn with you;
    for you have rejected Yahweh’s word, and Yahweh
    has rejected you from being king over Israel.” 27 As
    Samuel turned around to go away, Saul grabbed the
    skirt of his robe, and it tore. 28 Samuel said to him,
    “Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you
    today, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who
    is better than you. 29 Also the Strength of Israel will
    notlie norrepent; for he is not a man,that he should
    repent.”
    30 Then he said, “I have sinned; yet please honor
    me now before the elders of my people and before
    Israel, and come back with me, that I may worship
    Yahweh your God.”
    31 So Samuel went back with Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh. 32 Then Samuel said, “Bring Agag
    the king of the Amalekites here to me!”
    Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, “Surely
    the bitterness of death is past.”
    33 Samuel said, “As your sword has made women
    childless, so your mother will be childless among
    women!” Then Samuel cut Agag in pieces before
    Yahweh in Gilgal.
    34 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went
    up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. 35 Samuel came
    no more to see Saul until the day of his death, but
    Samuel mourned for Saul. Yahweh grieved that he
    had made Saul king over Israel.
    16
    1 Yahweh said to Samuel, “How long will you
    mourn for Saul,since I have rejected him from being
    king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I
    will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have
    provided a king for myself among his sons.”
    2 Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he
    will kill me.”
    Yahweh said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, ‘I
    have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.’ 3 Call Jesse to the
    sacrifice, and I willshow you what you shall do. You
    shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.”
    4 Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came
    to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet
    him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?”
    5 He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to
    Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me
    to the sacrifice.” He sanctified Jesse and his sons,
    and called them to the sacrifice. 6 When they had
    come, he looked at Eliab, and said, “Surely Yahweh’s
    anointed is before him.”
    7 But Yahweh said to Samuel, “Don’t look on his
    face, or on the height of his stature, because I have
    rejected him; for I don’t see as man sees. For man
    looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks
    at the heart.”
    8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass
    before Samuel. He said, “Yahweh has not chosen
    this one, either.” 9 Then Jesse made Shammah to
    pass by. He said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one,
    either.” 10 Jesse made seven of his sons to pass
    before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has
    not chosen these.” 11 Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all
    your children here?”
    He said, “There remains yet the youngest. Behold, he is keeping the sheep.”
    Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and get him, for we
    will not sit down until he comes here.”
    12 He sent, and brought him in. Now he was
    ruddy, with a handsome face and good appearance.
    Yahweh said, “Arise! Anoint him, for this is he.”
    13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed
    him in the middle of his brothers. Then Yahweh’s
    Spirit came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.
    14 Now Yahweh’s Spirit departed from Saul, and
    an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him. 15 Saul’s
    servants said to him, “See now, an evil spirit from
    God troubles you. 16 Let our lord now command
    your servants who are in front of you to seek out a
    man who is a skillful player on the harp. Then when
    the evil spirit from God is on you, he will play with
    his hand, and you will be well.”
    17 Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now a
    man who can play well, and bring him to me.”
    18 Then one of the young men answered and said,
    “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite
    who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor,
    a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome
    person; and Yahweh is with him.”
    19 Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and
    said, “Send me David your son, who is with the
    sheep.”
    20 Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a container of wine, and a young goat, and sent them
    by David his son to Saul. 21 David came to Saul
    and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and
    he became his armor bearer. 22 Saul sent to Jesse,
    saying, “Please let David stand before me, for he has
    found favor in my sight.” 23 When the spirit from
    * 15:23 teraphim were household idols that may have been associated with inheritance rights to the household property.
    1 Samuel 17:1 190 1 Samuel 17:37
    God was on Saul, David took the harp and played
    with his hand; so Saul was refreshed and was well,
    and the evil spirit departed from him.
    17
    1 Now the Philistines gathered together their
    armies to battle; and they were gathered together
    at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped
    between Socoh and Azekah in Ephesdammim. 2 Saul
    and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
    encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle
    in array against the Philistines. 3 The Philistines
    stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel
    stood on the mountain on the other side: and there
    was a valley between them. 4 A champion out of
    the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath,
    whose height was six cubits and a span* went out.
    5He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he wore
    a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five
    thousand shekels† of bronze. 6 He had bronze shin
    armor on his legs and a bronze javelin between his
    shoulders. 7The staff of hisspear waslike a weaver’s
    beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred
    shekels of iron.‡ His shield bearer went before him.
    8He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said
    to them, “Why have you come out to set your battle
    in array? Am I not a Philistine, and you servants
    to Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him
    come down to me. 9 If he is able to fight with me
    and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I
    prevail against him and kill him, then you will be
    our servants and serve us.” 10 The Philistine said, “I
    defy the armies of Israel today! Give me a man, that
    we may fight together!”
    11 When Saul and all Israel heard those words
    of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly
    afraid. 12 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite
    of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he
    had eight sons. The man was an elderly old man in
    the days of Saul. 13 The three oldest sons of Jesse
    had gone after Saul to the battle; and the names
    of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab
    the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the
    third Shammah. 14 David was the youngest; and the
    three oldest followed Saul. 15 Now David went back
    and forth from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at
    Bethlehem.
    16The Philistine came near morning and evening,
    and presented himself forty days.
    17 Jesse said to David his son, “Now take for your
    brothers an ephah§ of this parched grain and these
    ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to
    your brothers; 18 and bring these ten cheeses to
    the captain of their thousand; and see how your
    brothers are doing, and bring back news.” 19 Now
    Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel were in the
    valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
    20 David rose up early in the morning and left
    the sheep with a keeper, and took the provisions
    and went, as Jesse had commanded him. He came
    to the place of the wagons as the army which was
    going outto the fightshouted forthe battle. 21 Israel
    and the Philistines put the battle in array, army
    against army. 22 David left his baggage in the hand
    of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the army,
    and came and greeted his brothers. 23 As he talked
    with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of
    Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of
    the Philistines, and said the same words; and David
    heard them. 24 All the men of Israel, when they saw
    the man, fled from him and were terrified. 25 The
    men of Israelsaid, “Have you seen this man who has
    come up? He has surely come up to defy Israel. The
    king will give greatriches to the man who kills him,
    and will give him his daughter, and will make his
    father’s house tax-free in Israel.”
    26 David spoke to the men who stood by him,
    saying, “What shall be done to the man who kills
    this Philistine and takes away the reproach from
    Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine,
    that he should defy the armies of the living God?”
    27 The people answered him in this way, saying,
    “So shall it be done to the man who kills him.”
    28 Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke
    to the men; and Eliab’s anger burned against David,
    and he said, “Why have you come down? With
    whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the evil of your heart;
    for you have come down that you might see the
    battle.”
    29 David said, “What have I now done? Is there
    not a cause?” 30 He turned away from him toward
    another, and spoke like that again; and the people answered him again the same way. 31 When
    the words were heard which David spoke, they
    rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.
    32David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heartfail because
    of him. Your servant will go and fight with this
    Philistine.”
    33 Saul said to David, “You are not able to go
    against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are
    but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.”
    34 David said to Saul, “Your servant was keeping
    his father’s sheep; and when a lion or a bear came
    and took a lamb out of the flock, 35 I went out
    after him, struck him, and rescued it out of his
    mouth. When he arose against me, I caught him
    by his beard, struck him, and killed him. 36 Your
    servant struck both the lion and the bear. This
    uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them,
    since he has defied the armies of the living God.”
    37David said, “Yahweh, who delivered me out of the
    paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, will
    deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.”
    Saulsaid to David, “Go! Yahweh will be with you.”
    * 17:4 A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters. A span is
    the length from the tip of a man’s thumb to the tip of his little finger when his hand is stretched out (about half a cubit, or 9 inches, or 22.8
    cm.) Therefore, Goliath was about 9 feet and 9 inches or 2.97 meters tall. † 17:5 A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, so 5000
    shekels is about 50 kilograms or 110 pounds. ‡ 17:7 A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, so 600 shekels is about 6 kilograms
    or about 13 pounds. § 17:17 1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3 of a bushel
    1 Samuel 17:38 191 1 Samuel 18:21
    38 Saul dressed David with his clothing. He put a
    helmet of bronze on his head, and he clad him with
    a coat of mail. 39 David strapped his sword on his
    clothing and he tried to move, for he had not tested
    it. David said to Saul, “I can’t go with these, for I
    have not tested them.” Then David took them off.
    40 He took his staff in his hand, and chose for
    himself five smooth stones out ofthe brook, and put
    them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag which he
    had. His sling was in his hand; and he came near
    to the Philistine. 41 The Philistine walked and came
    near to David; and the man who bore the shield
    went before him. 42 When the Philistine looked
    around and saw David, he disdained him; for he was
    but a youth, and ruddy, and had a good looking face.
    43 The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that
    you come to me with sticks?” The Philistine cursed
    David by his gods. 44 The Philistine said to David,
    “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds
    of the sky and to the animals of the field.”
    45 Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to
    me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin;
    but I come to you in the name of Yahweh of Armies,
    the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have
    defied. 46 Today, Yahweh will deliver you into my
    hand. I will strike you and take your head from off
    you. I will give the dead bodies of the army of the
    Philistines today to the birds of the sky and to the
    wild animals of the earth, that all the earth may
    know that there is a God in Israel, 47 and that all this
    assembly may know that Yahweh doesn’t save with
    sword and spear; for the battle is Yahweh’s, and he
    will give you into our hand.”
    48 When the Philistine arose, and walked and
    came near to meet David, David hurried and ran
    toward the army to meet the Philistine. 49 David
    put his hand in his bag, took a stone and slung it,
    and struck the Philistine in his forehead. The stone
    sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the
    earth. 50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with
    a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine
    and killed him; but there was no sword in David’s
    hand. 51 Then David ran, stood over the Philistine,
    took his sword, drew it out of its sheath, killed him,
    and cut off his head with it.
    When the Philistines saw that their champion
    was dead, they fled. 52 The men of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines
    asfar as Gai and to the gates of Ekron. The wounded
    of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim,
    even to Gath and to Ekron. 53 The children of Israel
    returned from chasing after the Philistines, and
    they plundered their camp. 54 David took the head
    of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but
    he put his armor in his tent. 55 When Saul saw
    David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner,
    the captain of the army, “Abner, whose son is this
    youth?”
    Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I can’t
    tell.”
    56 The king said, “Inquire whose son the young
    man is!”
    57 As David returned from the slaughter of the
    Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before
    Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
    58 Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, you young
    man?”
    David answered, “I am the son of your servant
    Jesse the Bethlehemite.”
    18
    1 When he had finished speaking to Saul, the soul
    of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and
    Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 2 Saul took
    him that day, and wouldn’t let him go home to his
    father’s house any more. 3Then Jonathan and David
    made a covenant, because he loved him as his own
    soul. 4 Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that
    was on him and gave it to David with his clothing,
    even including his sword, his bow, and his sash.
    5 David went out wherever Saul sent him, and
    behaved himself wisely; and Saul set him over the
    men of war. It was good in the sight of allthe people,
    and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.
    6 As they came, when David returned from the
    slaughter of the Philistine, the women came out
    of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to
    meet King Saul with tambourines, with joy, and
    with instruments of music. 7 The women sang to
    one another as they played, and said,
    “Saul has slain his thousands,
    and David his ten thousands.”
    8 Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased
    him. He said, “They have credited David with
    ten thousands, and they have only credited me
    with thousands. What can he have more but the
    kingdom?” 9 Saul watched David from that day and
    forward. 10 On the next day, an evil spirit from God
    came mightily on Saul, and he prophesied in the
    middle of the house. David played with his hand,
    as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his
    hand; 11 and Saul threw the spear, for he said, “I
    will pin David to the wall!” David escaped from his
    presence twice. 12 Saul was afraid of David, because
    Yahweh was with him, and had departed from Saul.
    13 Therefore Saul removed him from his presence,
    and made him his captain over a thousand; and he
    went out and came in before the people.
    14 David behaved himself wisely in all his ways;
    and Yahweh was with him. 15When Saulsaw that he
    behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.
    16 But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went
    out and came in before them. 17 Saul said to David,
    “Behold, my elder daughter Merab. I will give her
    to you as wife. Only be valiant for me, and fight
    Yahweh’s battles.” For Saulsaid, “Don’t let my hand
    be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on
    him.”
    18 David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my
    life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be
    son-in-law to the king?”
    19 But at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter,
    should have been given to David, she was given to
    Adriel the Meholathite as wife.
    20 Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David; and they
    told Saul, and the thing pleased him. 21 Saul said, I
    will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him
    and that the hand of the Philistines may be against
    1 Samuel 18:22 192 1 Samuel 20:3
    him. Therefore Saul said to David a second time,
    “You shall today be my son-in-law.”
    22 Saul commanded hisservants, “Talk with David
    secretly, and say, ‘Behold, the king has delight in
    you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore
    be the king’s son-in-law.’ ”
    23 Saul’sservantsspoke those wordsin the ears of
    David. David said, “Does it seem to you a light thing
    to be the king’s son-in-law, since I am a poor man
    and little known?”
    24 The servants of Saul told him, saying, “David
    spoke like this.”
    25 Saul said, “Tell David, ‘The king desires
    no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the
    Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies.’ ”
    Now Saul thought he would make David fall by the
    hand of the Philistines. 26 When his servants told
    David these words, it pleased David well to be the
    king’s son-in-law. Before the deadline, 27 David
    arose and went, he and his men, and killed two hundred men of the Philistines. Then David brought
    their foreskins, and they gave them in full number
    to the king, that he might be the king’s son-in-law.
    Then Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.
    28 Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David;
    and Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him. 29 Saul was
    even more afraid of David; and Saul was David’s
    enemy continually.
    30 Then the princes of the Philistines went out;
    and as often as they went out, David behaved himself more wisely than allthe servants of Saul,so that
    his name was highly esteemed.
    19
    1 Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his
    servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan,
    Saul’s son, greatly delighted in David. 2 Jonathan
    told David, saying, “Saul my fatherseeks to kill you.
    Now therefore, please take care of yourself in the
    morning, live in a secret place, and hide yourself. 3 I
    will go out and stand beside my father in the field
    where you are, and I will talk with my father about
    you; and if I see anything, I will tell you.”
    4 Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father,
    and said to him, “Don’t let the king sin against his
    servant, against David; because he has not sinned
    against you, and because his works have been very
    good toward you; 5 for he put hislife in his hand and
    struck the Philistine, and Yahweh worked a great
    victory for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why
    then will you sin against innocent blood, to kill
    David without a cause?”
    6 Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan; and Saul
    swore, “As Yahweh lives, he shall not be put to
    death.”
    7 Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed
    him all those things. Then Jonathan brought David
    to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.
    8There was war again. David went out and fought
    with the Philistines, and killed them with a great
    slaughter; and they fled before him.
    9An evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saul as he sat
    in his house with his spear in his hand; and David
    was playing music with his hand. 10 Saul sought to
    pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped
    away out of Saul’s presence; and he stuck the spear
    into the wall. David fled and escaped that night.
    11 Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch
    him and to kill him in the morning. Michal, David’s
    wife, told him, saying, “If you don’t save your life
    tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.” 12 So Michal
    let David down through the window. He went away,
    fled, and escaped. 13 Michal took the teraphim* and
    laid itin the bed, and put a pillow of goats’ hair atits
    head and covered it with clothes. 14 When Saul sent
    messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.”
    15 Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying,
    “Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill
    him.” 16 When the messengers came in, behold, the
    teraphim was in the bed, with the pillow of goats’
    hair at its head.
    17 Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived
    me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has
    escaped?”
    Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go!
    Why should I kill you?’ ”
    18 Now David fled and escaped, and came to
    Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had
    done to him. He and Samuel went and lived in
    Naioth. 19 Saul was told, saying, “Behold, David is
    at Naioth in Ramah.”
    20 Saul sent messengers to seize David; and when
    they saw the company ofthe prophets prophesying,
    and Samuel standing as head over them, God’s
    Spirit came on Saul’s messengers, and they also
    prophesied. 21 When Saul was told, he sent other
    messengers, and they also prophesied. Saul sent
    messengers again the third time, and they also
    prophesied. 22 Then he also went to Ramah, and
    came to the great well that is in Secu: and he asked,
    “Where are Samuel and David?”
    One said, “Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.”
    23 He went there to Naioth in Ramah. Then
    God’s Spirit came on him also, and he went on, and
    prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 24He
    also stripped off his clothes. He also prophesied
    before Samuel and lay down naked all that day and
    all that night. Therefore they say, “Is Saul also
    among the prophets?”
    20
    1 David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and
    said to Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my
    iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he
    seeks my life?”
    2 He said to him, “Far from it; you will not die.
    Behold, my father does nothing either great or
    small, but that he discloses it to me. Why would my
    father hide this thing from me? It is not so.”
    3 David swore moreover, and said, “Your father
    knows well that I have found favorin your eyes; and
    he says, ‘Don’t let Jonathan know this, lest he be
    * 19:13 teraphim were household idols that may have been associated with inheritance rights to the household property.
    1 Samuel 20:4 193 1 Samuel 21:2
    grieved;’ but truly as Yahweh lives, and as your soul
    lives, there is but a step between me and death.”
    4 Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever your
    soul desires, I will even do it for you.”
    5 David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is
    the new moon, and I should not fail to dine with
    the king; but let me go, that I may hide myself in
    the field to the third day at evening. 6 If your father
    misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked
    leave of me that he mightrun to Bethlehem, his city;
    for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.’
    7 If he says, ‘It is well,’ yourservantshall have peace;
    but if he is angry, then know that evil is determined
    by him. 8 Therefore deal kindly with your servant,
    for you have brought your servant into a covenant
    of Yahweh with you; but if there is iniquity in me,
    kill me yourself, for why should you bring me to
    your father?”
    9 Jonathan said, “Far be it from you; forif Ishould
    at all know that evil were determined by my father
    to come on you, then wouldn’t I tell you that?”
    10 Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me
    if your father answers you roughly?”
    11 Jonathan said to David, “Come! Let’s go out
    into the field.” They both went out into the field.
    12 Jonathan said to David, “By Yahweh, the God of
    Israel, when I have sounded out my father about
    this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if
    there is good toward David, won’t I then send to
    you and disclose it to you? 13 Yahweh do so to
    Jonathan and more also, should it please my father
    to do you evil, if I don’t disclose it to you and
    send you away, that you may go in peace. May
    Yahweh be with you as he has been with my father.
    14 You shall not only show me the loving kindness
    of Yahweh while I still live, that I not die; 15 but
    you shall also not cut off your kindness from my
    house forever, no, not when Yahweh has cut off
    every one of the enemies of David from the surface
    of the earth.” 16 So Jonathan made a covenant with
    David’s house,saying, “Yahweh willrequire it at the
    hand of David’s enemies.”
    17 Jonathan caused David to swear again, for
    the love that he had to him; for he loved him as
    he loved his own soul. 18 Then Jonathan said to
    him, “Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be
    missed, because your seat will be empty. 19 When
    you have stayed three days, go down quickly and
    come to the place where you hid yourself when this
    started, and remain by the stone Ezel. 20 I will shoot
    three arrows on its side, as though I shot at a mark.
    21 Behold, I will send the boy, saying, ‘Go, find the
    arrows!’ If I tell the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are on
    this side of you. Take them;’ then come, for there
    is peace to you and no danger, as Yahweh lives.
    22 But if I say this to the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are
    beyond you,’ then go your way, for Yahweh hassent
    you away. 23 Concerning the matter which you and I
    have spoken of, behold, Yahweh is between you and
    me forever.”
    24 So David hid himself in the field. When the new
    moon had come, the king sat himself down to eat
    food. 25 The king sat on his seat, as at other times,
    even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up,
    and Abner sat by Saul’s side, but David’s place was
    empty. 26Nevertheless Saul didn’tsay anything that
    day, for he thought, “Something has happened to
    him. He is not clean. Surely he is not clean.”
    27On the next day afterthe new moon,the second
    day, David’s place was empty. Saul said to Jonathan
    his son, “Why didn’t the son of Jesse come to eat,
    either yesterday, or today?”
    28 Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly
    asked permission of me to go to Bethlehem. 29 He
    said, ‘Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice
    in the city. My brother has commanded me to be
    there. Now, if I have found favorin your eyes, please
    let me go away and see my brothers.’ Therefore he
    has not come to the king’s table.”
    30 Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan,
    and he said to him, “You son of a perverse rebellious
    woman, don’t I know that you have chosen the son
    of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of
    your mother’s nakedness? 31 For as long as the
    son of Jesse lives on the earth, you will not be
    established, nor will your kingdom. Therefore now
    send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die!”
    32 Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to
    him, “Why should he be put to death? What has he
    done?”
    33 Saul cast his spear at him to strike him. By this
    Jonathan knew that his father was determined to
    put David to death. 34 So Jonathan arose from the
    table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day
    of the month; for he was grieved for David, because
    his father had treated him shamefully.
    35 In the morning, Jonathan went out into the
    field at the time appointed with David, and a little
    boy with him. 36 He said to his boy, “Run, find
    now the arrows which I shoot.” As the boy ran, he
    shot an arrow beyond him. 37 When the boy had
    come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had
    shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, “Isn’t
    the arrow beyond you?” 38 Jonathan cried after the
    boy, “Go fast! Hurry! Don’t delay!” Jonathan’s boy
    gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.
    39 But the boy didn’t know anything. Only Jonathan
    and David knew the matter. 40 Jonathan gave his
    weaponsto his boy, and said to him, “Go, carry them
    to the city.”
    41 As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out
    of the south, and fell on his face to the ground,
    and bowed himself three times. They kissed one
    another and wept with one another, and David wept
    the most. 42 Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace,
    because we have both sworn in Yahweh’s name,
    saying, ‘Yahweh is between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring, forever.’ ”
    He arose and departed; and Jonathan went into the
    city

    Psalm fifty nine:

    For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Do Not
    Destroy.” A poem by David, when Saul sent, and
    they watched the house to kill him.
    1 Deliver me from my enemies, my God.
    Set me on high from those who rise up against
    me.
    2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.
    Save me from the bloodthirsty men.
    3 For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul.
    Psalms 59:4 373 Psalms 62:4
    The mighty gather themselves together
    against me,
    not for my disobedience, nor for my sin, Yahweh.
    4 I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack
    me.
    Rise up, behold, and help me!
    5 You, Yahweh God of Armies, the God of Israel,
    rouse yourself to punish the nations.
    Show no mercy to the wicked traitors.
    Selah.
    6 They return at evening, howling like dogs,
    and prowl around the city.
    7 Behold, they spew with their mouth.
    Swords are in their lips,
    “For”, they say, “who hears us?”
    8 But you, Yahweh, laugh at them.
    You scoff at all the nations.
    9 Oh, my Strength, I watch for you,
    for God is my high tower.
    10 My God will go before me with his loving kindness.
    God will let me look at my enemiesin triumph.
    11 Don’t kill them, or my people may forget.
    Scatter them by your power, and bring them
    down, Lord our shield.
    12 For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their
    lips,
    let them be caught in their pride,
    for the curses and lies which they utter.
    13 Consume them in wrath.
    Consume them, and they will be no more.
    Let them know that God rules in Jacob,
    to the ends of the earth.
    Selah.
    14 At evening let them return.
    Let them howl like a dog, and go around the
    city.
    15 They shall wander up and down for food,
    and wait all night if they aren’t satisfied.
    16 But I will sing of your strength.
    Yes, I will sing aloud of yourloving kindness in
    the morning.
    For you have been my high tower,
    a refuge in the day of my distress.
    17 To you, my strength, I will sing praises.
    For God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.

    The First Book of Samuel, Chapter twenty-one:
    21
    1 Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the
    priest. Ahimelech came to meet David trembling,
    and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no man
    with you?” 2 David said to Ahimelech the priest,
    “The king has commanded me to do something, and
    hassaid to me, ‘Let no one know anything about the
    1 Samuel 21:3 194 1 Samuel 22:20
    business about which I send you, and what I have
    commanded you. I have sent the young men to a
    certain place.’ 3 Now therefore what is under your
    hand? Please give me five loaves of bread in my
    hand, or whatever is available.”
    4 The priest answered David, and said, “I have no
    common bread, but there is holy bread; if only the
    young men have kept themselves from women.”
    5 David answered the priest, and said to him,
    “Truly, women have been kept from us as usual
    these three days. When I came out, the vessels
    of the young men were holy, though it was only
    a common journey. How much more then today
    shall their vessels be holy?” 6 So the priest gave
    him holy bread; forthere was no bread there butthe
    show bread that was taken from before Yahweh, to
    be replaced with hot bread in the day when it was
    taken away.
    7 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul
    was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and
    his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the
    herdsmen who belonged to Saul.
    8David said to Ahimelech, “Isn’t there here under
    your hand spear orsword? ForI haven’t brought my
    sword or my weapons with me, because the king’s
    business required haste.”
    9 The priest said, “Behold, the sword of Goliath
    the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah,
    is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you
    would like to take that, take it, for there is no other
    except that here.”
    David said, “There is none like that. Give it to
    me.”
    10 David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul,
    and went to Achish the king of Gath. 11The servants
    of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David the king of
    the land? Didn’tthey sing to one another about him
    in dances, saying,
    ‘Saul has slain his thousands,
    and David his ten thousands?’ ”
    12 David laid up these words in his heart, and
    was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath. 13 He
    changed his behavior before them and pretended to
    be insane in their hands, and scribbled on the doors
    of the gate, and let hisspittle fall down on his beard.
    14 Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see
    the man is insane. Why then have you brought him
    to me? 15 Do I lack madmen, that you have brought
    this fellow to play the madman in my presence?
    Should this fellow come into my house?”

    Psalm fifty two:
    52
    For the Chief Musician. A contemplation by David,
    when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, “David
    has come to Ahimelech’s house.”
    1 Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man?
    God’s loving kindness endures continually.
    2 Your tongue plots destruction,
    like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
    3 You love evil more than good,
    lying rather than speaking the truth.
    Selah.
    4 You love all devouring words,
    you deceitful tongue.
    5 God will likewise destroy you forever.
    He will take you up, and pluck you out of your
    tent,
    and root you out of the land of the living.
    Selah.
    6 The righteous also will see it, and fear,
    and laugh at him, saying,
    7 “Behold, this is the man who didn’t make God his
    strength,
    but trusted in the abundance of his riches,
    and strengthened himself in his wickedness.”
    8 But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God’s
    house.
    I trust in God’s loving kindness forever and
    ever.
    9 I will give you thanks forever, because you have
    done it.
    I will hope in your name, for it is good,
    in the presence of your saints.

<p>
    Psalm thirty four:
    34
    By David; when he pretended to be insane before
    Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.
    1 * I will bless Yahweh at all times.
    His praise will always be in my mouth.
    2 My soul shall boast in Yahweh.
    The humble shall hear of it and be glad.
    3 Oh magnify Yahweh with me.
    Let’s exalt his name together.
    4 I sought Yahweh, and he answered me,
    and delivered me from all my fears.
    5 They looked to him, and were radiant.
    Theirfaces shall never be covered with shame.
    6 This poor man cried, and Yahweh heard him,
    and saved him out of all his troubles.
    7 Yahweh’s angel encamps around those who fear
    him,
    and delivers them.
    8 Oh taste and see that Yahweh is good.
    Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
    9 Oh fear Yahweh, you his saints,
    for there is no lack with those who fear him.
    10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger,
    but those who seek Yahweh shall not lack any
    good thing.
    11 Come, you children, listen to me.
    I will teach you the fear of Yahweh.
    12 Who is someone who desires life,
    and loves many days, that he may see good?
    13 Keep your tongue from evil,
    and your lips from speaking lies.
    14 Depart from evil, and do good.
    Seek peace, and pursue it.
    15 Yahweh’s eyes are toward the righteous.
    His ears listen to their cry.
    16 Yahweh’s face is against those who do evil,
    to cut off their memory from the earth.
    17 The righteous cry, and Yahweh hears,
    and delivers them out of all their troubles.
    18Yahweh is nearto those who have a broken heart,
    and saves those who have a crushed spirit.
    19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
    but Yahweh delivers him out of them all.
    20 He protects all of his bones.
    Not one of them is broken.
    21 Evil shall kill the wicked.
    Those who hate the righteous shall be condemned.
    22 Yahweh redeems the soul of his servants.
    None of those who take refuge in him shall be
    condemned.

    Psalm fifty six:
    56
    For the Chief Musician. To the tune of “Silent Dove
    in Distant Lands.” A poem by David, when the
    Philistines seized him in Gath.
    1 Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow
    me up.
    All day long, he attacks and oppresses me.
    2 My enemies want to swallow me up all day long,
    for they are many who fight proudly against
    me.
    3 When I am afraid,
    I will put my trust in you.
    4 In God, I praise his word.
    In God, I put my trust.
    I will not be afraid.
    What can flesh do to me?
    5 All day long they twist my words.
    All their thoughts are against me for evil.
    6 They conspire and lurk,
    watching my steps.
    They are eager to take my life.
    7 Shall they escape by iniquity?
    In anger cast down the peoples, God.
    8 You count my wanderings.
    You put my tears into your container.
    Aren’t they in your book?
    9 Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I
    call.
    I know this: that God is for me.
    10 In God, I will praise his word.
    In Yahweh, I will praise his word.
    11 I have put my trust in God.
    I will not be afraid.
    What can man do to me?
    12 Your vows are on me, God.
    I will give thank offerings to you.
    13 For you have delivered my soul from death,
    and prevented my feet from falling,
    that I may walk before God in the light of the
    living.
