     Now Yahweh said to Abram, 'Leave your country, and your relatives,
    and your father's house, and
    go to the land that I will show you.  I will make of
    you a great nation. I will bless you and make your
    name great. You will be a blessing.  I will bless
    those who bless you, and I will curse him who treats
    you with contempt. All the families of the earth will
    be blessed through you.'
     So Abram went, as Yahweh had told him. Lot
    went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old
    when he departed from Haran.  Abram took Sarai
    his wife, Lot his brother's son, all their possessions
    that they had gathered, and the people whom they
    had acquired in Haran, and they went to go into
    the land of Canaan. They entered into the land of
    Canaan.  Abram passed through the land to the
    place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time,
    Canaanites were in the land.
    Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, 'I will give
    this land to your offspring.'*
    He built an altar there to Yahweh, who had
    appeared to him.  He left from there to go to the
    mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent,
    having Bethel on the west, and Ai on the east. There
    he built an altar to Yahweh and called on Yahweh's
    name.  Abram traveled, still going on toward the
    South.
     There was a famine in the land. Abram went
    down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there, for the
    famine was severe in the land. When he had come
    near to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, 'See
    now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look
    at.  It will happen that when the Egyptians see
    you,they will say, 'This is his wife.' They will kill me,
    but they will save you alive.  Please say that you
    are my sister, that it may be well with me for your
    sake, and that my soul may live because of you.'
     When Abram had come into Egypt, Egyptians
    saw that the woman was very beautiful.  The
    princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to
    Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's
    house.  He dealt well with Abram for her
    sake. He had sheep, cattle, male donkeys, male
    servants, female servants, female donkeys, and
    camels.  Yahweh afflicted Pharaoh and his house
    with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
     Pharaoh called Abram and said, 'What is this that
    you have done to me? Why didn't you tell me that
    she was your wife?  Why did you say, 'She is
    my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Now
    therefore,see your wife, take her, and go your way.'
     Pharaoh commanded men concerning him,
    and they escorted him away with his wife and all
    that he had.
    
     Abram went up out of Egypt-he, his wife, all
    that he had, and Lot with him -into the South.
     Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in
    gold.  He went on his journeys from the South as
    far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at
    the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,  to the place
    of the altar, which he had made there at the first.
    There Abram called on Yahweh's name.  Lot also,
    who went with Abram, had flocks, herds, and tents.
     The land was not able to bear them, that they
    might live together; for their possessions were so
    great that they couldn't live together.  There was
    strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock
    and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock. The Canaanites
    and the Perizzites lived in the land at that time.
     Abram said to Lot, 'Please, let there be no strife
    between you and me, and between your herdsmen
    and my herdsmen; for we are relatives.  Isn't the
    whole land before you? Please separate yourself
    from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go
    to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I
    will go to the left.'
     Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of
    the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere,
    before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah,
    like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt,
    as you go to Zoar.  So Lot chose the Plain of
    the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they
    separated themselves from one other.  Abram
    lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities
    of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
     Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked
    and sinners against Yahweh.
     Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated
    from him, 'Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the
    place where you are, northward and southward and
    eastward and westward,  forI will give all the land
    which you see to you and to your offspring forever.
     I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth,
    so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then
    your offspring may also be counted.  Arise, walk
    through the land in its length and in its width; for I
    will give it to you.'
    
     Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by
    the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built
    an altar there to Yahweh.
    
     In the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar; Arioch,
    king of Ellasar; Chedorlaomer, king of Elam; and
    Tidal, king of Goiim,  they made war with Bera,
    king of Sodom; Birsha, king of Gomorrah; Shinab,
    king of Admah; Shemeber, king of Zeboiim; and the
    king of Bela (also called Zoar).  All these joined
    together in the valley of Siddim (also called the Salt
    Sea).  They served Chedorlaomer for twelve years,
    and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.  In the
    fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who
    were with him came and struck the Rephaim in
    Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim
    in Shaveh Kiriathaim,  and the Horites in their
    Mount Seir, to El Paran, which is by the wilderness.
     They returned, and came to En Mishpat (also
    called Kadesh), and struck all the country of the
    Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in
    Hazazon Tamar.  The king of Sodom, and the
    king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of
    Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also called Zoar) went
    out; and they set the battle in array against them in
    the valley of Siddim  against Chedorlaomer king of
    Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar,
    and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the
    five.  Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar
    pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled,
    and some fell there. Those who remained fled to
    the hills.  They took all the goods of Sodom and
    Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way.
     They took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who lived
    in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
     One who had escaped came and told Abram,
    the Hebrew. At that time, he lived by the oaks of
    Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother
    of Aner. They were allies of Abram.  When Abram
    heard that his relative was taken captive, he led
    out his three hundred eighteen trained men, born
    in his house, and pursued as far as Dan.  He
    divided himself against them by night, he and his
    servants, and struck them, and pursued them to
    Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. He
    brought back all the goods, and also brought back
    his relative Lot and his goods, and the women also,
    and the other people.

     The king of Sodom went out to meet him after
    his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and
    the kings who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh
    (that is, the King's Valley).  Melchizedek king of
    Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of
    God Most High. He blessed him, and said, 'Blessed
    be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven
    and earth.  Blessed be God Most High, who has
    delivered your enemies into your hand.'

    Abram gave him a tenth of all.

     The king of Sodom said to Abram, 'Give me the
    people, and take the goods for yourself.'
     Abram said to the king of Sodom, 'I have lifted
    up my hand to Yahweh, God Most High, possessor of
    heaven and earth,  that I will not take a thread nor
    a sandal strap nor anything that is yours, lest you
    should say, 'I have made Abram rich.'  I will accept
    nothing from you except that which the young men
    have eaten, and the portion of the men who went
    with me: Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take
    their portion.'
    
     After these things Yahweh's word came to
    Abram in a vision, saying, 'Don't be afraid, Abram.
    I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.'
     Abram said, 'Lord* Yahweh, what will you give
    me, since I go childless, and he who will inherit
    my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?'  Abram said,
    'Behold, you have given no children to me: and,
    behold, one born in my house is my heir.'
     Behold, Yahweh's word came to him, saying,
    'This man will not be your heir, but he who will
    come out of your own body will be your heir.'
     Yahweh brought him outside, and said, 'Look now
    toward the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to
    count them.' He said to Abram, 'So your offspring
    will be.'  He believed in Yahweh, who credited it
    to him for righteousness.  He said to Abram, 'I am
    Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees,
    to give you this land to inherit it.'
     He said, 'Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I
    will inherit it?'
     He said to him, 'Bring me a heifer three years
    old, a female goat three years old, a ram three
    years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.'  He
    brought him all these, and divided them in the
    middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but
    he didn't divide the birds.  The birds of prey
    came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them
    away.
    When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell
    on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on
    him.  He said to Abram, 'Know for sure that your
    off spring will live as foreigners in a land that is not
    theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them
    four hundred years.  I will also judge that nation,
    whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out
    with great wealth;  but you will go to your fathers
    in peace. You will be buried at a good old age.  In
    the fourth generation they will come here again, for
    the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.'  It came
    to pass that, when the sun went down, and it was
    dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a flaming torch
    passed between these pieces.  In that day Yahweh
    made a covenant with Abram, saying, 'I have given
    this land to your offspring, from the river of Egypt
    to the great river, the river Euphrates:  the land
    of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
     the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,  the
    Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the
    Jebusites.'
    
     Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children.
    She had a servant, an Egyptian, whose name was
    Hagar.  Sarai said to Abram, 'See now, Yahweh

    has restrained me from bearing. Please go in to
    my servant. It may be that I will obtain children
    by her.' Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
     Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her
    servant, after Abram had lived ten years in the land
    of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband
    to be his wife.  He went in to Hagar, and she
    conceived. When she saw that she had conceived,
    her mistress was despised in her eyes.  Sarai said
    to Abram, 'This wrong is your fault. I gave my
    servant into your bosom, and when she saw that she
    had conceived,she despised me. May Yahweh judge
    between me and you.'
    But Abram said to Sarai, 'Behold, your maid isin
    your hand. Do to her whatever is good in your eyes.'
    Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her
    face.
    Yahweh's angel found her by a fountain of water
    in the wilderness, by the fountain on the way to
    Shur.  He said, 'Hagar, Sarai's servant, where did
    you come from? Where are you going?'
    She said, 'I am fleeing from the face of my
    mistress Sarai.'
     Yahweh's angel said to her, 'Return to your
    mistress, and submit yourself under her hands.'
    Yahweh's angel said to her, 'I will greatly multiply
    your offspring, that they will not be counted for
    multitude.'  Yahweh's angel said to her, 'Behold,
    you are with child, and will bear a son. You shall call
    his name Ishmael, because Yahweh has heard your
    affliction.  He will be like a wild donkey among
    men. His hand will be against every man, and every
    man's hand against him. He will live opposed to all
    of his brothers.'
     She called the name of Yahweh who spoke to
    her, 'You are a God who sees,' for she said, 'Have
    I even stayed alive after seeing him?'  Therefore
    the well was called Beer Lahai Roi.* Behold, it is
    between Kadesh and Bered.
     Hagar bore a son for Abram. Abram called
    the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.
     Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore
    Ishmael to Abram.
    
    When Abram was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh
    appeared to Abram and said to him, 'I am God
    Almighty. Walk before me and be blameless.  I will
    make my covenant between me and you, and will
    multiply you exceedingly.'
     Abram fell on his face. God talked with him,
    saying,  'As for me, behold, my covenant is with
    you. You will be the father of a multitude of nations.
    Your name will no more be called Abram, but your
    name will be Abraham; for I have made you the
    father of a multitude of nations.  I will make you
    exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you.
    Kings will come out of you.  I will establish my
    covenant between me and you and your offspring
    after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant,
    to be a God to you and to your
    offspring after you.  I will give to you, and to
    your offspring after you, the land where you are
    traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting
    possession. I will be their God.'
     God said to Abraham, 'As for you, you shall
    keep my covenant, you and your offspring after
    you throughout their generations.  This is my
    covenant, which you shall keep, between me and
    you and your offspring after you. Every male
    among you shall be circumcised.  You shall be
    circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin. It will be
    a token of the covenant between me and you.  He
    who is eight days old shall be circumcised among
    you, every male throughout your generations, he
    who is born in the house, or bought with money
    from any foreigner who is not of your offspring.
     He who is born in your house, and he who is
    bought with your money, must be circumcised. My
    covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting
    covenant.  The uncircumcised male who is not
    circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul
    shall be cut off from his people. He has broken my
    covenant.'
     God said to Abraham, 'As for Sarai your wife,
    you shall not call her name Sarai, but her name shall
    be Sarah.  I will bless her, and moreover I will give
    you a son by her. Yes, I will bless her, and she will
    be a mother of nations. Kings of peoples will come
    from her.'
     Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed,
    and said in his heart, 'Will a child be born to him
    who is one hundred years old? Will Sarah, who is
    ninety years old, give birth?'  Abraham said to
    God, 'Oh that Ishmael might live before you!'
     God said, 'No, but Sarah, your wife, will bear
    you a son. You shall call his name Isaac.* I will
    establish my covenant with him for an everlasting
    covenant for his offspring after him.  As for
    Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I have blessed
    him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply
    him exceedingly. He will become the father of
    twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.
    But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom
    Sarah will bear to you at this set time next year.'
     When he finished talking with him, God went
    up from Abraham.  Abraham took Ishmael his
    son, all who were born in his house, and all who
    were bought with his money: every male among
    the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the
    flesh of their foreskin in the same day, as God had
    said to him.  Abraham was ninety-nine years old
    when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
     Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he
    was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  In the
    same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were
    circumcised.  All the men of his house, those born
    in the house, and those bought with money from a
    foreigner, were circumcised with him.
    
     Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre,
    as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day.
    He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three



    men stood near him. When he saw them, he ran to
    meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself
    to the earth,  and said, 'My lord, if now I have found
    favor in your sight, please don't go away from your
    servant.  Now let a little water be fetched, wash
    your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.  I will
    get a piece of bread so you can refresh your heart.
    After that you may go your way, now that you have
    come to your servant.'
    They said, 'Very well, do as you have said.'
     Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and
    said, 'Quickly prepare three seahs* of fine meal,
    knead it, and make cakes.'  Abraham ran to the
    herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave
    it to the servant. He hurried to dress it.  He took
    butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and
    set it before them. He stood by them under the tree,
    and they ate.
     They asked him, 'Where is Sarah, your wife?'
    He said, 'There, in the tent.'
    He said, 'I will certainly return to you at about
    this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will
    have a son.'
    Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind
    him.  Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well
    advanced in age. Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.
    Sarah laughed within herself, saying,
    'AfterI have grown old will I have pleasure, my lord
    being old also?'
     Yahweh said to Abraham, 'Why did Sarah
    laugh, saying, 'Will I really bear a child when I am
    old?'  Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set
    time I will return to you, when the season comes
    around, and Sarah will have a son.'
     Then Sarah denied it, saying, 'I didn't laugh,'
    for she was afraid.
    He said, 'No, but you did laugh.'
    The men rose up from there, and looked toward
    Sodom. Abraham went with them to see them on
    their way.  Yahweh said, 'Will I hide from Abraham what I do,  since Abraham will surely become
    a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the
    earth will be blessed in him?  For I have known
    him, to the end that he may command his children
    and his household after him, that they may keep
    the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice;
    to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham
    that which he has spoken of him.'  Yahweh said,
    'Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great,
    and because their sin is very grievous,  I will go
    down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad
    as the reports which have come to me. If not, I will
    know.'
     The men turned from there, and went toward
    Sodom, but Abraham stood yet before Yahweh.
     Abraham came near, and said, 'Will you consume
    the righteous with the wicked?  What if there are
    fifty righteous within the city? Will you consume
    and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who
    are in it?  May it be far from you to do things like
    that, to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that
    the righteous should be like the wicked. May that
    be far from you. Shouldn't the Judge of all the earth
    do right?'
     Yahweh said, 'If I find in Sodom fifty righteous
    within the city, then I will spare the whole place for
    their sake.'  Abraham answered, 'See now, I have
    taken it on myself to speak to the Lord, although I
    am dust and ashes.  What if there will lack five of
    the fifty righteous? Will you destroy all the city for
    lack of five?'
    He said, 'I will not destroy it if I find forty-five
    there.'
     He spoke to him yet again, and said, 'What if
    there are forty found there?'
    He said, 'I will not do it for the forty's sake.'
     He said, 'Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I
    will speak. What if there are thirty found there?'
    He said, 'I will not do it if I find thirty there.'
     He said, 'See now, I have taken it on myself to
    speak to the Lord. What if there are twenty found
    there?'
    He said, 'I will not destroy it for the twenty's
    sake.'
     He said, 'Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and
    I will speak just once more. What if ten are found
    there?'
    He said, 'I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.'
    Yahweh went his way As soon as he had finished
    communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned
    to his place.
    
     The two angels came to Sodom at evening. Lot
    sat in the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, and rose
    up to meet them. He bowed himself with his face to
    the earth,  and he said, 'See now, my lords, please
    come into your servant's house, stay all night, wash
    your feet, and you can rise up early, and go on your
    way.'
    They said, 'No, but we will stay in the street all
    night.'
     He urged them greatly, and they came in with
    him, and entered into his house. He made them a
    feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
     But before they lay down, the men of the city, the
    men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young
    and old, all the people from every quarter.  They
    called to Lot, and said to him, 'Where are the men
    who came in to you this night? Bring them out to
    us, that we may have sex with them.'
     Lot went out to them through the door, and
    shut the door after himself.  He said, 'Please, my
    brothers, don't act so wickedly.  See now, I have
    two virgin daughters. Please let me bring them out
    to you, and you may do to them what seems good to
    you. Only don't do anything to these men, because
    they have come under the shadow of my roof.'
     They said, 'Stand back!' Then they said, 'This
    one fellow came in to live as a foreigner, and he
    appoints himself a judge. Now we will deal worse
    with you than with them!' They pressed hard on
    the man Lot, and came near to break the door. But
    the men reached out their hand, and brought Lot
    into the house to them, and shut the door.  They

    struck the men who were at the door of the house
    with blindness, both small and great, so that they
    wearied themselves to find the door.
    The men said to Lot, 'Do you have anybody else
    here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and
    whomever you have in the city, bring them out of
    the place:  for we will destroy this place, because
    the outcry against them has grown so great before
    Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.'
     Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who
    were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, 'Get
    up! Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the
    city!'
    But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.
    When the morning came, then the angels hurried
    Lot, saying, 'Get up! Take your wife and your two
    daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in
    the iniquity of the city.'  But he lingered; and the
    men grabbed his hand, his wife's hand, and his two
    daughters' hands, Yahweh being merciful to him;
    and they took him out, and set him outside of the
    city.  It came to pass, when they had taken them
    out, that he said, 'Escape for your life! Don't look
    behind you, and don't stay anywhere in the plain.
    Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!'
     Lot said to them, 'Oh, not so, my lord.  See
    now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and
    you have magnified your loving kindness, which
    you have shown to me in saving my life. I can't
    escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I
    die.  See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is
    a little one. Oh let me escape there (isn't it a little
    one?), and my soul will live.'
     He said to him, 'Behold, I have granted your
    request concerning this thing also, that I will not
    overthrow the city of which you have spoken.
     Hurry, escape there, for I can't do anything until
    you get there.' Therefore the name of the city was
    called Zoar.*
     The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came
    to Zoar.  Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on
    Gomorrah sulfur and fire from Yahweh out of the
    sky.  He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all
    the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew
    on the ground.  But Lot's wife looked back from
    behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
     Abraham went up early in the morning to the
    place where he had stood before Yahweh.  He
    looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all
    the land of the plain, and saw that the smoke of the
    land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
     When God destroyed the cities of the plain,
    God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the
    middle of the overthrow, when he overthrew the
    cities in which Lot lived.
     Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the
    mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he
    was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his
    two daughters.  The firstborn said to the younger,
    'Our father is old, and there is not a man in the
    earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth.
     Come, let's make our father drink wine, and we
    will lie with him, that we may preserve our father's
    family line.'  They made their father drink wine
    that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with
    her father. He didn't know when she lay down, nor
    when she arose.  It came to pass on the next day,
    that the firstborn said to the younger, 'Behold, I
    lay last night with my father. Let's make him drink
    wine again tonight. You go in, and lie with him, that
    we may preserve our father's family line.'  They
    made their father drink wine that night also. The
    younger went and lay with him. He didn't know
    when she lay down, nor when she got up.  Thus
    both of Lot's daughters were with child by their
    father.  The firstborn bore a son, and named
    him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this
    day.  The younger also bore a son, and called his
    name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of
    Ammon to this day.
    
    Abraham traveled from there toward the land of
    the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He
    lived as a foreigner in Gerar.  Abraham said about
    Sarah his wife, 'She is my sister.' Abimelech king
    of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.  But God came to
    Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him,
    'Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman
    whom you have taken; for she is a man's wife.'
     Now Abimelech had not come near her. He
    said, 'Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?
     Didn't he tell me, 'She is my sister'? She, even she
    herself, said, 'He is my brother.' I have done this in
    the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my
    hands.'
     God said to him in the dream, 'Yes, I know
    that in the integrity of your heart you have done
    this, and I also withheld you from sinning against
    me. Therefore I didn't allow you to touch her.
     Now therefore, restore the man's wife. For he is a
    prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live.
    If you don't restore her, know for sure that you will
    die, you, and all who are yours.'
    Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called
    all his servants, and told all these things in their ear.
    The men were very scared.  Then Abimelech called
    Abraham, and said to him, 'What have you done to
    us? How have I sinned against you, that you have
    brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You
    have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!'
     Abimelech said to Abraham, 'What did you see,
    that you have done this thing?'
     Abraham said, 'Because I thought, 'Surely the
    fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for
    my wife's sake.'  Besides, she is indeed my sister,
    the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of
    my mother; and she became my wife.  When God
    caused me to wander from my father's house, I said
    to her, 'This is your kindness which you shall show
    to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, 'He is my
    brother.'
    Abimelech took sheep and cattle, male servants
    and female servants, and gave them to Abraham,
    and restored Sarah, his wife, to him.  Abimelech
    
    said, 'Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where
    it pleases you.'  To Sarah he said, 'Behold, I
    have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver.
    Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that
    are with you. In front of all you are vindicated.'
     Abraham prayed to God. So God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants, and they
    bore children.  For Yahweh had closed up tight all
    the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of
    Sarah, Abraham's wife.
    
     Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah as he had spoken.
    Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the
    set time of which God had spoken to him. Abraham
    called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah
    bore to him, Isaac.*  Abraham circumcised his
    son, Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had
    commanded him. Abraham was one hundred years
    old when his son, Isaac, was born to him.  Sarah
    said, 'God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears
    will laugh with me.'  She said, 'Who would have
    said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children?
    For I have borne him a son in his old age.'
    The child grew and was weaned. Abraham made
    a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
     Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom
    she had borne to Abraham, mocking.  Therefore
    she said to Abraham, 'Cast out this servant and her
    son! For the son of this servant will not be heir with
    my son, Isaac.'
    The thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight
    on account of his son.  God said to Abraham,
    'Don't let it be grievous in your sight because of the
    boy, and because of your servant. In all that Sarah
    says to you, listen to her voice. For your offspring
    will be named through Isaac.  I will also make a
    nation of the son of the servant, because he is your
    child.'  Abraham rose up early in the morning,
    and took bread and a container of water, and gave
    it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her
    the child, and sent her away. She departed, and
    wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.  The
    water in the container was spent, and she put the
    child under one of the shrubs.  She went and sat
    down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow
    shot away. For she said, 'Don't let me see the death
    of the child.' She sat opposite him, and lifted up her
    voice, and wept.  God heard the voice of the boy.
    The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky,
    and said to her, 'What troubles you, Hagar? Don't
    be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the boy
    where he is.  Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him
    with your hand. ForI will make him a great nation.'
     God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of
    water. She went, filled the container with water,
    and gave the boy a drink.
     God was with the boy, and he grew. He lived
    in the wilderness, and as he grew up, he became an
    archer.  He lived in the wilderness of Paran. His
    mother got a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.
     At that time, Abimelech and Phicol the captain
    of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, 'God is with
    you in all that you do.  Now, therefore, swear to
    me here by God that you will not deal falsely with
    me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. But
    according to the kindness that I have done to you,
    you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have
    lived as a foreigner.'
     Abraham said, 'I will swear.'  Abraham
    complained to Abimelech because of a water well,
    which Abimelech's servants had violently taken
    away.  Abimelech said, 'I don't know who has
    done this thing. You didn't tell me, and I didn't hear
    of it until today.'
     Abraham took sheep and cattle, and gave
    them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant.
     Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by
    themselves.  Abimelech said to Abraham, 'What
    do these seven ewe lambs, which you have set by
    themselves, mean?'
     He said, 'You shall take these seven ewe lambs
    from my hand, that it may be a witness to me,
    that I have dug this well.'  Therefore he called
    that place Beersheba, because they both swore
    an oath there.  So they made a covenant at
    Beersheba. Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the
    captain of his army, and they returned into the land
    of the Philistines.  Abraham planted a tamarisk
    tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name
    of Yahweh, the Everlasting God. Abraham lived as
    a foreigner in the land of the Philistines many days.
    
     After these things, God tested Abraham, and
    said to him, 'Abraham!'
    He said, 'Here I am.'
     He said, 'Now take your son, your only son,
    Isaac, whom you love, and go into the land of
    Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one
    of the mountains which I will tell you of.'
    Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled
    his donkey; and took two of his young men with
    him, and Isaac his son. He split the wood for the
    burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place
    of which God had told him.  On the third day
    Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far
    off.  Abraham said to his young men, 'Stay here
    with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there.
    We will worship, and come back to you.' Abraham
    took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on
    Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the
    knife. They both went together.  Isaac spoke to
    Abraham his father, and said, 'My father?'
    He said, 'Here I am, my son.'
    He said, 'Here is the fire and the wood, but where
    is the lamb for a burnt offering?'
     Abraham said, 'God will provide himself the
    lamb for a burnt offering, my son.' So they both
    went together.  They came to the place which God
    had told him of. Abraham built the altar there, and
    laid the wood in order, bound Isaac his son, and laid

    him on the altar, on the wood. Abraham stretched
    out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son.
    Yahweh's angel called to him out of the sky, and
    said, 'Abraham, Abraham!'
    He said, 'Here I am.'
     He said, 'Don't lay your hand on the boy or do
    anything to him. For now I know that you fear God,
    since you have not withheld your son, your only
    son, from me.'
    Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw
    that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket
    by his horns. Abraham went and took the ram,
    and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of
    his son.  Abraham called the name of that place
    'Yahweh Will Provide'.* As it is said to this day, 'On
    Yahweh's mountain, it will be provided.'
     Yahweh's angel called to Abraham a second
    time out of the sky,  and said, ' 'I have sworn
    by myself,' says Yahweh, 'because you have done
    this thing, and have not withheld your son, your
    only son,  that I will bless you greatly, and I will
    multiply your offspring greatly like the stars of the
    heavens, and like the sand which is on the seashore.
    Your offspring will possess the gate of his enemies.
    All the nations of the earth will be blessed by your
    offspring, because you have obeyed my voice.' '
     So Abraham returned to his young men, and
    they rose up and went together to Beersheba. Abraham lived at Beersheba.
     After these things, Abraham was told, 'Behold,
    Milcah, she also has borne children to your brother
    Nahor:  Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel
    the father of Aram,  Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.'
    Bethuel became the father
    of Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor,
    Abraham's brother.  His concubine, whose name
    was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and
    Maacah.
    
     Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years.
    This was the length of Sarah's life.  Sarah died
    in Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron), in the land of
    Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to
    weep for her.  Abraham rose up from before his
    dead and spoke to the children of Heth, saying,  'I
    am a stranger and a foreigner living with you. Give
    me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I
    may bury my dead out of my sight.'
    The children of Heth answered Abraham,saying
    to him,  'Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God
    among us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs.
    None of us will withhold from you his tomb. Bury
    your dead.'
     Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the
    people of the land, to the children of Heth.  He
    talked with them,saying, 'If you agree that Ishould
    bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat
    for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,  that he may sell
    me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which isin
    the end of his field. For the full price let him sell it
    to me among you as a possession for a burial place.'
     Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the
    children of Heth. Ephron the Hittite answered
    Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth,
    even of all who went in at the gate of his city,saying,
     'No, my lord, hear me. I give you the field, and I
    give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of
    the children of my people I give it to you. Bury your
    dead.'
     Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
    He spoke to Ephron in the
    audience of the people of the land, saying, 'But if
    you will, please hear me. I will give the price of
    the field. Take it from me, and I will bury my dead
    there.'
     Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
     'My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of land
    worth four hundred shekels of silver* between me
    and you? Therefore bury your dead.'
     Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham
    weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named
    in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred
    shekels of silver, according to the current merchants' standard.
    So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah,
    which was before Mamre, the field, the cave which
    was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that
    were in all of its borders, were deeded  to Abraham
    for a possession in the presence of the children of
    Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
     After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the
    cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that
    is, Hebron), in the land of Canaan.  The field, and
    the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham by the
    children of Heth as a possession for a burial place.
    
     Abraham was old, and well advanced in
    age. Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things.
    Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house,
    who ruled over all that he had, 'Please put your
    hand under my thigh.  I will make you swear by
    Yahweh,the God of heaven and the God of the earth,
    that you shall not take a wife for my son of the
    daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live.
    But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives,
    and take a wife for my son Isaac.'
     The servant said to him, 'What if the woman
    isn't willing to follow me to this land? Must I bring
    your son again to the land you came from?'
     Abraham said to him, 'Beware that you don't
    bring my son there again.  Yahweh, the God of
    heaven-who took me from my father's house, and
    from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and
    who swore to me, saying, 'I will give this land to
    your offspring-he will send his angel before you,
    and you shall take a wife for my son from there.  If
    the woman isn't willing to follow you,then you shall
    be clear from this oath to me. Only you shall not
    bring my son there again.'
     The servant put his hand under the thigh of
    Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning
    this matter.  The servant took ten of his master's

    camels, and departed, having a variety of good
    things of his master's with him. He arose, and
    went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.  He
    made the camels kneel down outside the city by the
    well of water at the time of evening, the time that
    women go out to draw water.  He said, 'Yahweh,
    the God of my master Abraham, please give me
    success today, and show kindness to my master
    Abraham.  Behold, I am standing by the spring
    of water. The daughters of the men of the city are
    coming out to draw water.  Let it happen, that the
    young lady to whom I willsay, 'Please let down your
    pitcher, that I may drink,' then she says, 'Drink, and
    I will also give your camels a drink,'-let her be the
    one you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By
    thisI will know that you have shown kindness to my
    master.'
     Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah came out,
    who was born to Bethuel the son
    of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother,
    with her pitcher on her shoulder.  The young lady
    was very beautiful to look at, a virgin. No man had
    known her. She went down to the spring, filled her
    pitcher, and came up.  The servant ran to meet
    her, and said, 'Please give me a drink, a little water
    from your pitcher.'
     She said, 'Drink, my lord.' She hurried, and
    let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him a
    drink.  When she had finished giving him a drink,
    she said, 'I will also draw for your camels, until
    they have finished drinking.'  She hurried, and
    emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again
    to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
     The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining
    silent, to know whether Yahweh had made his
    journey prosperous or not.  As the camels had
    done drinking, the man took a golden ring of half
    a shekel* weight, and two bracelets for her hands
    of ten shekels weight of gold,  and said, 'Whose
    daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in
    your father's house for us to stay?'
     She said to him, 'I am the daughter of Bethuel
    the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.'  She
    said more over to him, 'We have both straw and feed
    enough, and room to lodge in.'
     The man bowed his head, and worshiped Yahweh.
    He said, 'Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my
    master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving
    kindness and his truth toward my master. As for
    me, Yahweh has led me on the way to the house of
    my master's relatives.'
     The young lady ran, and told her mother's
    house about these words.  Rebekah had a brother,
    and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man,
    to the spring.  When he saw the ring, and the
    bracelets on his sister's hands, and when he heard
    the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, 'This is
    what the man said to me,' he came to the man.
    Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
    He said, 'Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do
    you stand outside? For I have prepared the house,
    and room for the camels.'
    The man came into the house, and he unloaded
    the camels. He gave straw and feed for the camels,
    and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men
    who were with him.  Food was set before him to
    eat, but he said, 'I will not eat until I have told my
    message.'
    Laban said, 'Speak on.'
     He said, 'I am Abraham's servant.  Yahweh
    has blessed my master greatly. He has become
    great. Yahweh has given him flocks and herds,silver
    and gold, male servants and female servants, and
    camels and donkeys.  Sarah, my master's wife,
    bore a son to my master when she was old. He has
    given all that he has to him.  My master made me
    swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son
    from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land
    I live,  but you shall go to my father's house, and to
    my relatives, and take a wife for my son.'  I asked
    my master, 'What if the woman will not follow me?'
     He said to me, 'Yahweh, before whom I walk, will
    send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You
    shall take a wife for my son from my relatives, and of
    my father's house. Then you will be clear from my
    oath, when you come to my relatives. If they don't
    give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.'
     I came today to the spring, and said, 'Yahweh, the
    God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper
    my way which I go-  behold, I am standing by
    this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden
    who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, 'Please
    give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,'
     then she tells me, 'Drink, and I will also draw for
    your camels,'-let her be the woman whom Yahweh
    has appointed for my master's son.'  Before I
    had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah
    came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She
    went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her,
    'Please let me drink.'  She hurried and let down
    her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, 'Drink, and
    I will also give your camels a drink.' So I drank,
    and she also gave the camels a drink.  I asked her,
    and said, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The
    daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah
    bore to him.' I put the ring on her nose, and the
    bracelets on her hands.  I bowed my head, and
    worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of
    my master Abraham, who had led me in the right
    way to take my master's brother's daughter for his
    son. Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my
    master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the
    right hand, or to the left.'
     Then Laban and Bethuel answered, 'The thing
    proceeds from Yahweh. We can't speak to you bad
    or good.  Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take her,
    and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as
    Yahweh has spoken.'
    When Abraham's servant heard their words, he
    bowed himself down to the earth to Yahweh.  The
    servant brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of
    gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He
    also gave precious things to her brother and her
    mother.  They ate and drank, he and the men who
    were with him, and stayed all night. They rose up

    in the morning, and he said, 'Send me away to my
    master.'
     Her brother and her mother said, 'Let the
    young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten.
    After that she will go.'
     He said to them, 'Don't hinder me, since Yahweh has prospered my way. Send me away that I
    may go to my master.'
     They said, 'We will call the young lady, and ask
    her.'  They called Rebekah, and said to her, 'Will
    you go with this man?'
    She said, 'I will go.'
     They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her
    nurse, Abraham's servant, and his men.  They
    blessed Rebekah, and said to her, 'Our sister, may
    you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands,
    and let your offspring possess the gate of those who
    hate them.'
     Rebekah arose with her ladies. They rode on
    the camels, and followed the man. The servant took
    Rebekah, and went his way.  Isaac came from the
    way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived in the land of
    the South.  Isaac went out to meditate in the field
    at the evening. He lifted up his eyes and looked.
    Behold,there were camels coming. Rebekah lifted
    up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she got off the
    camel.  She said to the servant, 'Who is the man
    who is walking in the field to meet us?'
    The servant said, 'It is my master.'
    She took her veil, and covered herself.  The
    servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
     Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent,
    and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. He
    loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother's
    death.
    
     Abraham took another wife, and her name was
    Keturah.  She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan,
    Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.  Jokshan became the
    father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan
    were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.  The
    sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida,
    and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
     Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,
    but Abraham gave gifts to the sons of Abraham's concubines.
    While he still lived, he sent them away from Isaac
    his son, eastward, to the east country.  These are
    the days of the years of Abraham's life which he
    lived: one hundred seventy-five years.  Abraham
    gave up his spirit, and died at a good old age, an
    old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his
    people.  Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in
    the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the
    son of Zohar the Hittite, which is near Mamre,  the
    field which Abraham purchased from the children
    of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his
    wife.  After the death of Abraham, God blessed
    Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.
     Now this is the history of the generations of
    Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian,
    Sarah's servant, bore to Abraham.  These are
    the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names,
    according to the order of their birth: the firstborn
    of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
     Mishma, Dumah, Massa,  Hadad, Tema, Jetur,
    Naphish, and Kedemah.  These are the sons
    of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their
    villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes,
    according to their nations.  These are the years of
    the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years.
    He gave up his spirit and died, and was gathered to
    his people.  They lived from Havilah to Shur that
    is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived
    opposite all his relatives.
     This is the history of the generations of Isaac,
    Abraham's son. Abraham became the father of
    Isaac.  Isaac was forty years old when he took
    Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of
    Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be
    his wife.  Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife,
    because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated
    by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.  The
    children struggled together within her. She said, 'If
    it is like this, why do I live?' She went to inquire of
    Yahweh.  Yahweh said to her,
    'Two nations are in your womb.
    Two peoples will be separated from your body.
    The one people will be stronger than the other
    people.
    The elder will serve the younger.'
     When her days to be delivered were fulfilled,
    behold, there were twins in her womb.  The first
    came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They
    named him Esau. After that, his brother came out,
    and his hand had hold on Esau's heel. He was named
    Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.
     The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a
    man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in
    tents.  Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his
    venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.  Jacob boiled stew.
    Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.
     Esau said to Jacob, 'Please feed me with some of
    that red stew, for I am famished.' Therefore his
    name was called Edom.*
     Jacob said, 'First, sell me your birthright.'
     Esau said, 'Behold, I am about to die. What
    good is the birthright to me?'
     Jacob said, 'Swear to me first.'
    He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.
     Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew. He ate and
    drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised
    his birthright.
    
     There was a famine in the land, in addition to
    the first famine that was in the days of Abraham.
    Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to
    Gerar.  Yahweh appeared to him, and said, 'Don't
    go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you
    about.  Live in this land, and I will be with you,
    and will bless you. For I will give to you, and to
    your offspring, all these lands, and I will establish
    the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.
     I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the
    sky, and will give all these lands to your offspring.
    
    In your offspring all the nations of the earth will
    be blessed,  because Abraham obeyed my voice,
    and kept my requirements, my commandments, my
    statutes, and my laws.'
     Isaac lived in Gerar.  The men of the place
    asked him about his wife. He said, 'She is my
    sister,' for he was afraid to say, 'My wife', lest,
    he thought, 'the men of the place might kill me
    for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.'
     When he had been there a long time, Abimelech
    king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and
    saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his
    wife.  Abimelech called Isaac, and said, 'Behold,
    surely she is your wife. Why did you say, 'She is my
    sister?' '
    Isaac said to him, 'Because I said, 'Lest I die
    because of her.' '
     Abimelech said, 'What is this you have done to
    us? One of the people might easily have lain with
    your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!'
     Abimelech commanded all the people, saying,
    'He who touches this man or his wife will surely be
    put to death.'
     Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the
    same year one hundred times what he planted.
    Yahweh blessed him.  The man grew great,
    and grew more and more until he became very
    great.  He had possessions of flocks, possessions
    of herds, and a great household. The Philistines
    envied him.  Now all the wells which his father's
    servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father,
    the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.
    Abimelech said to Isaac, 'Go away from us, for you
    are much mightier than we.'
     Isaac departed from there, encamped in the
    valley of Gerar, and lived there.
     Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they
    had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for
    the Philistines had stopped them after the death of
    Abraham. He called their names after the names by
    which his father had called them.  Isaac's servants
    dug in the valley, and found there a well of flowing*
    water.  The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac's
    herdsmen, saying, 'The water is ours.' So he called
    the name of the well Esek, because they contended
    with him. They dug another well, and they argued
    over that, also. So he called its name Sitnah.  He
    left that place, and dug another well. They didn't
    argue over that one. So he called it Rehoboth. He
    said, 'For now Yahweh has made room for us, and
    we will be fruitful in the land.'
    He went up from there to Beersheba. Yahweh
    appeared to him the same night, and said, 'I am the
    God of Abraham your father. Don't be afraid, for I
    am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your
    offspring for my servant Abraham's sake.'
     He built an altar there, and called on Yahweh's
    name, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac's
    servants dug a well.
     Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar with
    Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his
    army.  Isaac said to them, 'Why have you come to
    me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from
    you?'
     They said, 'We saw plainly that Yahweh was
    with you. We said, 'Let there now be an oath
    between us, even between us and you, and let's
    make a covenant with you,  that you will do us no
    harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have
    done to you nothing but good, and have sent you
    away in peace.' You are now the blessed of Yahweh.'
     He made them a feast, and they ate and drank.
     They rose up some time in the morning, and
    swore an oath to one another. Isaac sent them away,
    and they departed from him in peace.  The same
    day, Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning
    the well which they had dug, and said to him,
    'We have found water.'  He called it 'Shibah'.*
    Therefore the name of the city is 'Beersheba' to
    this day.
     When Esau was forty years old, he took as
    wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and
    Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite.  They
    grieved Isaac's and Rebekah's spirits.
    
     When Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so
    that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son,
    and said to him, 'My son?'
    He said to him, 'Here I am.'
     He said, 'See now, I am old. I don't know the
    day of my death.  Now therefore, please take your
    weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to
    the field, and get me venison.  Make me savory
    food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may
    eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die.'
     Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his
    son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison,
    and to bring it.  Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son,
    saying, 'Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau
    your brother, saying,  'Bring me venison, and make
    me savory food, that I may eat, and bless you before
    Yahweh before my death.' Now therefore, my son,
    obey my voice according to that which I command
    you.  Go now to the flock and get me two good
    young goats from there. I will make them savory
    food for your father, such as he loves.  You shall
    bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that he
    may bless you before his death.'
     Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, 'Behold,
    Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth
    man.  What if my father touches me? I will seem
    to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on
    myself, and not a blessing.'
     His mother said to him, 'Let your curse be on
    me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them
    for me.'
     He went, and got them, and brought them to
    his mother. His mother made savory food, such as
    his father loved.  Rebekah took the good clothes
    
    of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the
    house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son.
     She put the skins of the young goats on his hands,
    and on the smooth of his neck.  She gave the
    savory food and the bread, which she had prepared,
    into the hand of her son Jacob.
     He came to his father, and said, 'My father?'
    He said, 'Here I am. Who are you, my son?'
     Jacob said to his father, 'I am Esau your firstborn.
    I have done what you asked me to do. Please
    arise, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may
    bless me.'
     Isaac said to his son, 'How is it that you have
    found it so quickly, my son?'
    He said, 'Because Yahweh your God gave me
    success.'
     Isaac said to Jacob, 'Please come near, that I
    may feel you, my son, whether you are really my
    son Esau or not.'
     Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him,
    and said, 'The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands
    are the hands of Esau.'  He didn't recognize him,
    because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau's
    hands. So he blessed him. He said, 'Are you really
    my son Esau?'
    He said, 'I am.'
     He said, 'Bring it near to me, and I will eat of
    my son's venison, that my soul may bless you.'
    He brought it near to him, and he ate. He brought
    him wine, and he drank.  His father Isaac said to
    him, 'Come near now, and kiss me, my son.'  He
    came near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of
    his clothing, and blessed him, and said,
    'Behold, the smell of my son
    is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has
    blessed.
     God give you of the dew of the sky,
    of the fatness of the earth,
    and plenty of grain and new wine.
     Let peoples serve you,
    and nations bow down to you.
    Be lord over your brothers.
    Let your mother's sons bow down to you.
    Cursed be everyone who curses you.
    Blessed be everyone who blesses you.'
     As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob,
    and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of
    Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his
    hunting.  He also made savory food, and brought
    it to his father. He said to his father, 'Let my father
    arise, and eat of his son's venison, that your soul
    may bless me.'
     Isaac his father said to him, 'Who are you?'
    He said, 'I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.'
     Isaac trembled violently, and said, 'Who, then,
    is he who has taken venison, and brought it to me,
    and I have eaten of all before you came, and have
    blessed him? Yes, he will be blessed.'
     When Esau heard the words of his father, he
    cried with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and
    said to his father, 'Bless me, even me also, my
    father.'
     He said, 'Your brother came with deceit, and
    has taken away your blessing.'
     He said, 'Isn't he rightly named Jacob? For
    he has supplanted me these two times. He took
    away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my
    blessing.' He said, 'Haven't you reserved a blessing
    for me?'
     Isaac answered Esau, 'Behold, I have made him
    your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him
    for servants. I have sustained him with grain and
    new wine. What then will I do for you, my son?'
     Esau said to his father, 'Do you have just one
    blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my
    father.' Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
     Isaac his father answered him,
    'Behold, your dwelling will be of the fatness of the
    earth,
    and of the dew of the sky from above.
     You will live by your sword, and you will serve
    your brother.
    It will happen, when you will break loose,
    that you will shake his yoke from off your neck.'
     Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with
    which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart,
    'The days of mourning for my father are at hand.
    Then I will kill my brother Jacob.'
     The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to
    Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger
    son, and said to him, 'Behold, your brother Esau
    comforts himself about you by planning to kill you.
    Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee
    to Laban, my brother, in Haran.  Stay with him
    a few days, until your brother's fury turns away-
     until your brother's anger turns away from you,
    and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I
    will send, and get you from there. Why should I be
    bereaved of you both in one day?'
     Rebekah said to Isaac, 'I am weary of my life
    because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a
    wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the
    daughters of the land, what good will my life do
    me?'
    
     Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded
    him, 'You shall not take a wife of the daughters of
    Canaan.  Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house
    of Bethuel your mother's father. Take a wife from
    there from the daughters of Laban, your mother's
    brother.  May God Almighty bless you, and make
    you fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a
    company of peoples,  and give you the blessing of
    Abraham, to you and to your offspring with you,
    that you may inherit the land where you travel,
    which God gave to Abraham.'
     Isaac sent Jacob away. He went to Paddan Aram
    to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of
    Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
     Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and
    sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife
    from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him
    a command, saying, 'You shall not take a wife of
    the daughters of Canaan;'  and that Jacob obeyed
    his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan
    Aram.  Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan
    didn't please Isaac, his father.  So Esau went to
      
    Ishmael, and took, in addition to the wives that he
    had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's
    son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
     Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went
    toward Haran.  He came to a certain place, and
    stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He
    took one of the stones of the place, and put it under
    his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.  He
    dreamed and saw a stairway set upon the earth, and
    its top reached to heaven. Behold, the angels of
    God were ascending and descending on it. Behold,
    Yahweh stood above it, and said, 'I am Yahweh, the
    God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac.
    I will give the land you lie on to you and to your
    offspring.  Your offspring will be as the dust of
    the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west,
    and to the east, and to the north, and to the south.
    In you and in your offspring, all the families of the
    earth will be blessed.  Behold, I am with you, and
    will keep you, wherever you go, and will bring you
    again into this land. For I will not leave you until I
    have done that which I have spoken of to you.'
     Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said,
    'Surely Yahweh is in this place, and I didn't know
    it.'  He was afraid, and said, 'How awesome this
    place is! This is none other than God's house, and
    this is the gate of heaven.'
     Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took
    the stone that he had put under his head, and set
    it up for a pillar, and poured oil on its top.  He
    called the name of that place Bethel, but the name
    of the city was Luz at the first.  Jacob vowed a vow,
    saying, 'If God will be with me, and will keep me
    in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat,
    and clothing to put on,  so that I come again to my
    father's house in peace, and Yahweh will be my God,
     then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar,
    will be God's house. Of all that you will give me I
    will surely give a tenth to you.'
    
    Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the
    land of the children of the east.  He looked, and
    saw a well in the field, and saw three flocks  
    lying there by it. For out of that well they watered
    the flocks. The stone on the well's mouth was large.
    There all the flocks were gathered. They rolled the
    stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep,
    and put the stone back on the well's mouth in its
    place.  Jacob said to them, 'My relatives, where are
    you from?'
    They said, 'We are from Haran.'
    He said to them, 'Do you know Laban, the son of
    Nahor?'
    They said, 'We know him.'
     He said to them, 'Is it well with him?'
    They said, 'It is well. See, Rachel, his daughter, is
    coming with the sheep.'
    He said, 'Behold, it is still the middle of the day,
    not time to gather the livestock together. Water the
    sheep, and go and feed them.'
     They said, 'We can't, until all the flocks are
    gathered together, and they roll the stone from the
    well's mouth. Then we will water the sheep.'
     While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel
    came with her father's sheep, for she kept them.
     When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban,
    his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his
    mother's brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the
    stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock
    of Laban his mother's brother.  Jacob kissed
    Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.  Jacob
    told Rachel that he was her father's relative, and
    that he was Rebekah's son. She ran and told her
    father.
     When Laban heard the news of Jacob, his
    sister's son, he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced
    him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house.
    Jacob told Laban all these things.  Laban said to
    him, 'Surely you are my bone and my flesh.' Jacob
    stayed with him for a month.  Laban said to Jacob,
    'Because you are my relative, should you therefore
    serve me for nothing? Tell me, what will your wages
    be?'
     Laban had two daughters. The name of the
    elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was
    Rachel.  Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was
    beautiful in form and attractive.  Jacob loved
    Rachel. He said, 'I will serve you seven years for
    Rachel, your younger daughter.'
     Laban said, 'It is better that I give her to you,
    than that I should give her to another man. Stay
    with me.'
     Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They
    seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had
    for her.
     Jacob said to Laban, 'Give me my wife, for my
    days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.'
     Laban gathered together all the men of the
    place, and made a feast.  In the evening, he took
    Leah his daughter, and brought her to Jacob. He
    went in to her.  Laban gave Zilpah his servant to
    his daughter Leah for a servant.  In the morning,
    behold, it was Leah! He said to Laban, 'What is this
    you have done to me? Didn't I serve with you for
    Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?'
     Laban said, 'It is not done so in our place, to
    give the younger before the firstborn.  Fulfill the
    week of this one, and we will give you the other
    also for the service which you will serve with me for
    seven more years.'
     Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. He gave
    him Rachel his daughter as wife.  Laban gave
    Bilhah, his servant, to his daughter Rachel to be her
    servant.  He went in also to Rachel, and he loved
    also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him
    seven more years.
     Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he
    opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.  Leah
    conceived, and bore a son, and she named him
    Reuben. For she said, 'Because Yahweh has looked
    at my affliction; for now my husband will love me.'
     She conceived again, and bore a son, and said,
    'Because Yahweh has heard that I am hated, he
    has therefore given me this son also.' She named
    him Simeon.  She conceived again, and bore a
    son. She said, 'Now this time my husband will
    be joined to me, because I have borne him three
      
    sons.' Therefore his name was called Levi.  She
    conceived again, and bore a son. She said, 'This
    time I will praise Yahweh.' Therefore she named
    him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.
    
     When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children,
    Rachel envied her sister. She said to Jacob,
    'Give me children, or else I will die.'
     Jacob's anger burned against Rachel, and he
    said, 'Am I in God's place, who has withheld from
    you the fruit of the womb?'
     She said, 'Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to
    her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may
    obtain children by her.'  She gave him Bilhah her
    servant as wife, and Jacob went in to her.  Bilhah
    conceived, and bore Jacob a son.  Rachel said, 'God
    has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has
    given me a son.' Therefore she called his name Dan.
    Bilhah, Rachel's servant, conceived again, and bore
    Jacob a second son.  Rachel said, 'I have wrestled
    with my sister with mighty wrestlings, and have
    prevailed.' She named him Naphtali.
     When Leah saw that she had finished bearing,
    she took Zilpah, her servant, and gave her to Jacob
    as a wife.  Zilpah, Leah's servant, bore Jacob a son.
     Leah said, 'How fortunate!' She named him Gad.
     Zilpah, Leah's servant, bore Jacob a second son.
     Leah said, 'Happy am I, for the daughters will call
    me happy.' She named him Asher.
     Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and
    found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to
    his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, 'Please
    give me some of your son's mandrakes.'
     Leah said to her, 'Is it a small matter that you
    have taken away my husband? Would you take away
    my son's mandrakes, also?'
    Rachel said, 'Therefore he will lie with you
    tonight for your son's mandrakes.'
     Jacob came from the field in the evening, and
    Leah went out to meet him, and said, 'You must
    come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my
    son's mandrakes.'
    He lay with her that night.  God listened to
    Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.
     Leah said, 'God has given me my hire, because I
    gave my servant to my husband.' She named him
    Issachar.  Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth
    son to Jacob.  Leah said, 'God has endowed me
    with a good dowry. Now my husband will live with
    me, because I have borne him six sons.' She named
    him Zebulun.  Afterwards, she bore a daughter,
    and named her Dinah.
     God remembered Rachel, and God listened to
    her, and opened her womb.  She conceived, bore
    a son, and said, 'God has taken away my reproach.'
     She named him Joseph,* saying, 'May Yahweh
    add another son to me.'
     When Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to
    Laban, 'Send me away, that I may go to my own
    place, and to my country.  Give me my wives and
    my children for whom I have served you, and let
    me go; for you know my service with which I have
    served you.'
     Laban said to him, 'If now I have found favor in
    your eyes, stay here, forI have divined that Yahweh
    has blessed me for your sake.'  He said, 'Appoint
    me your wages, and I will give it.'
     Jacob said to him, 'You know how I have served
    you, and how your livestock have fared with me.
     For it was little which you had before I came, and
    it has increased to a multitude. Yahweh has blessed
    you wherever I turned. Now when will I provide for
    my own house also?'
     Laban said, 'What shall I give you?'
    Jacob said, 'You shall not give me anything. If
    you will do this thing for me, I will again feed your
    flock and keep it.  I will pass through all your flock
    today, removing from there every speckled and
    spotted one, and every black one among the sheep,
    and the spotted and speckled among the goats. This
    will be my hire.  So my righteousness will answer
    for me hereafter, when you come concerning my
    hire that is before you. Every one that is not
    speckled and spotted among the goats, and black
    among the sheep, that might be with me, will be
    considered stolen.'
     Laban said, 'Behold, let it be according to your
    word.'
     That day, he removed the male goats that
    were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats
    that were speckled and spotted, every one that had
    white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep,
    and gave them into the hand of his sons.  He set
    three days' journey between himself and Jacob, and
    Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
     Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar,
    almond, and plane tree, peeled white streaks in them,
    and made the white appear which was in the rods.
     He set the rods which he had peeled opposite
    the flocks in the watering troughs where the flocks
    came to drink. They conceived when they came to
    drink.  The flocks conceived before the rods, and
    the flocks produced streaked,speckled, and spotted.
     Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of
    the flocks toward the streaked and all the black in
    Laban's flock. He put his own droves apart, and
    didn't put them into Laban's flock.  Whenever
    the stronger of the flock conceived, Jacob laid the
    rods in front of the eyes of the flock in the watering
    troughs, that they might conceive among the rods;
    but when the flock were feeble, he didn't put them
    in. So the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger
    Jacob's.  The man increased exceedingly, and had
    large flocks, female servants and male servants, and
    camels and donkeys.
    
     Jacob heard Laban's sons' words, saying, 'Jacob
    has taken away all that was our father's. He has
    obtained all this wealth from that which was our
    father's.'  Jacob saw the expression on Laban's
    face, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.
     Yahweh said to Jacob, 'Return to the land of your

    fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with
    you.'
     Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the
    field to his flock,  and said to them,
    'I see the expression on your father's face, that it is not toward
    me as before; but the God of my father has been with
    me.  You know that I have served your father with
    all of my strength.  Your father has deceived me,
    and changed my wages ten times, but God didn't
    allow him to hurt me.  If he said, 'The speckled
    will be your wages,' then all the flock bore speckled.
    If he said, 'The streaked will be your wages,' then
    all the flock bore streaked.  Thus God has taken
    away your father's livestock, and given them to me.
    During mating season, I lifted up my eyes, and saw
    in a dream, and behold,the male goats which leaped
    on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.
     The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,'
    and I said, 'Here I am.'  He said, 'Now lift up your
    eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on
    the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I
    have seen all that Laban does to you.  I am the God
    of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you
    vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this
    land, and return to the land of your birth.' '
     Rachel and Leah answered him, 'Is there yet
    any portion or inheritance for us in our father's
    house?  Aren't we considered as foreigners by
    him? For he has sold us, and has also used up our
    money.  For all the riches which God has taken
    away from our father are ours and our children's.
    Now then, whatever God has said to you, do.'
     Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his
    wives on the camels,  and he took away all his
    livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered,
    including the livestock which he had gained
    in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the
    land of Canaan.  Now Laban had gone to shear his
    sheep; and Rachel stole the teraphim* that were her
    father's.
     Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he
    didn't tell him that he was running away.  So he
    fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over
    the River, and set his face toward the mountain of
    Gilead.
     Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had
    fled.  He took his relatives with him, and pursued
    him seven days' journey. He overtook him in the
    mountain of Gilead. God came to Laban the Syrian
    in a dream of the night, and said to him, 'Be careful
    that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad.'
     Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had
    pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with
    his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead.
     Laban said to Jacob, 'What have you done, that
    you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?
    Why did you flee
    secretly, and deceive me, and didn't tell me, that
    I might have sent you away with mirth and with
    songs, with tambourine and with harp;  and didn't
    allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now
    have you done foolishly.  It is in the power of
    my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father
    spoke to me last night, saying, 'Be careful that you
    don't speak to Jacob either good or bad.'  Now,
    you want to be gone, because you greatly longed
    for your father's house, but why have you stolen my
    gods?'
     Jacob answered Laban, 'Because I was afraid,
    for I said, 'Lest you should take your daughters from
    me by force.'  Anyone you find your gods with
    shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is
    yours with me, and take it.' For Jacob didn't know
    that Rachel had stolen them.
     Laban went into Jacob's tent, into Leah's tent,
    and into the tent of the two female servants; but
    he didn't find them. He went out of Leah's tent,
    and entered into Rachel's tent.  Now Rachel had
    taken the teraphim, put them in the camel's saddle,
    and sat on them. Laban felt around all the tent, but
    didn't find them.  She said to her father, 'Don't let
    my lord be angry that I can't rise up before you; for
    I'm having my period.' He searched, but didn't find
    the teraphim.
     Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob
    answered Laban, 'What is my trespass? What is my
    sin, that you have hotly pursued me?  Now that
    you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you
    found of all your household stuff? Set it here before
    my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge
    between us two.
     'These twenty yearsI have been with you. Your
    ewes and your female goats have not cast their
    young, and I haven't eaten the rams of your flocks.
     That which was torn of animals, I didn't bring to
    you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it,
    whether stolen by day or stolen by night.  This
    was my situation: in the day the drought consumed
    me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from
    my eyes.  These twenty years I have been in your
    house. I served you fourteen years for your two
    daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have
    changed my wages ten times.  Unless the God
    of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of
    Isaac, had been with me,surely now you would have
    sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and
    the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night.'
     Laban answered Jacob, 'The daughters are my
    daughters, the children are my children, the flocks
    are my flocks, and all that you see is mine! What
    can I do today to these my daughters, or to their
    children whom they have borne? Now come, let's
    make a covenant, you and I. Let it be for a witness
    between me and you.'
     Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
     Jacob said to his relatives, 'Gather stones.' They
    took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by
    the heap.  Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but
    Jacob called it Galeed.  Laban said, 'This heap
    is witness between me and you today.' Therefore
    it was named Galeed  and Mizpah, for he said,
    'Yahweh watch between me and you, when we
    
      
    are absent one from another.  If you afflict my
    daughters, or if you take wives in addition to my
    daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness
    between me and you.'  Laban said to Jacob,
    'See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set
    between me and you.  May this heap be a witness,
    and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over
    this heap to you, and that you will not pass over
    this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.  The
    God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of
    their father, judge between us.' Then Jacob swore
    by the fear of his father, Isaac.  Jacob offered a
    sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to
    eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the
    mountain.  Early in the morning, Laban rose up,
    and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed
    them. Laban departed and returned to his place.
    
     Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God
    met him.  When he saw them, Jacob said, 'This
    is God's army.' He called the name of that place
    Mahanaim.*
     Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau,
    his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
     He commanded them, saying, 'This is what you
    shall tell my lord, Esau: 'This is what your servant,
    Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban,
    and stayed until now.  I have cattle, donkeys,
    flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have
    sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your
    sight.' ' The messengers returned to Jacob,saying,
    'We came to your brother Esau. He is coming to
    meet you, and four hundred men are with him.'
     Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed.
    He divided the people who were with him, along
    with the flocks, the herds, and the camels, into two
    companies.  He said, 'If Esau comes to the one
    company, and strikes it, then the company which
    is left will escape.'  Jacob said, 'God of my father
    Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who
    said to me, 'Return to your country, and to your
    relatives, and I will do you good,'  I am not worthy
    of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all
    the truth, which you have shown to your servant;
    for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan; and
    now I have become two companies.  Please deliver
    me from the hand of my brother, from the hand
    of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and strike me
    and the mothers with the children.  You said, 'I
    will surely do you good, and make your offspring as
    the sand of the sea, which can't be counted because
    there are so many.' '
     He stayed there that night, and took from that
    which he had with him a present for Esau, his
    brother:  two hundred female goats and twenty
    male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
     thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten
    bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals.  He
    delivered them into the hands of his servants, every
    herd by itself, and said to his servants, 'Pass over
    before me, and put a space between herd and herd.'
     He commanded the foremost, saying, 'When
    Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying,
    'Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are
    these before you?'  Then you shall say, 'They are
    your servant, Jacob's. It is a present sent to my
    lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.' '  He
    commanded also the second, and the third, and all
    that followed the herds, saying, 'This is how you
    shall speak to Esau, when you find him.  You shall
    say, 'Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob,
    is behind us.' ' For, he said, 'I will appease him with
    the present that goes before me, and afterward I will
    see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.'
     So the present passed over before him, and he
    himself stayed that night in the camp.
     He rose up that night, and took his two wives,
    and his two servants, and his eleven sons, and
    crossed over the ford of the Jabbok. He took them,
    and sent them over the stream, and sent over that
    which he had.  Jacob was left alone, and wrestled
    with a man there until the breaking of the day.
     When he saw that he didn't prevail against him,
    the man touched the hollow of his thigh, and the
    hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained as he wrestled.
     The man said, 'Let me go, for the day breaks.'
    Jacob said, 'I won't let you go unless you bless
    me.'
     He said to him, 'What is your name?'
    He said, 'Jacob'.
     He said, 'Your name will no longer be called
    Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and
    with men, and have prevailed.'
     Jacob asked him, 'Please tell me your name.'
    He said, 'Why is it that you ask what my name
    is?' So he blessed him there.
     Jacob called the name of the place Peniel;
    for he said, 'I have seen God face to face, and my
    life is preserved.'  The sun rose on him as he
    passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his
    thigh.  Therefore the children of Israel don't eat
    the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the
    thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of
    Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.
    
     Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold,
    Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men.
    He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and
    the two servants.  He put the servants and their
    children in front, Leah and her children after, and
    Rachel and Joseph at the rear.  He himself passed
    over in front of them, and bowed himself to the
    ground seven times, until he came near to his
    brother.
     Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his
    neck, kissed him, and they wept.  He lifted up his
    eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said,
    'Who are these with you?'
    He said, 'The children whom God has graciously
    given your servant.'  Then the servants came near
    with their children, and they bowed themselves.
     Leah also and her children came near, and bowed
    
      
    themselves. After them, Joseph came near with
    Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
     Esau said, 'What do you mean by all this company which I met?'
    Jacob said, 'To find favor in the sight of my lord.'
     Esau said, 'I have enough, my brother; let that
    which you have be yours.'
     Jacob said, 'Please, no, ifI have now found favor
    in your sight, then receive my present at my hand,
    because I have seen your face, as one sees the face
    of God, and you were pleased with me. Please take
    the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt
    graciously with me, and because I have enough.' He
    urged him, and he took it.
     Esau said, 'Let's take our journey, and let's go,
    and I will go before you.'
     Jacob said to him, 'My lord knows that the
    children are tender, and that the flocks and herds
    with me have their young, and if they overdrive
    them one day, all the flocks will die.  Please let
    my lord pass over before his servant, and I will lead
    on gently, according to the pace of the livestock
    that are before me and according to the pace of the
    children, until I come to my lord to Seir.'
     Esau said, 'Let me now leave with you some of
    the people who are with me.'
    He said, 'Why? Let me find favor in the sight of
    my lord.'
     So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.
     Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house,
    and made shelters for his livestock. Therefore the
    name of the place is called Succoth.*
     Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem,
    which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from
    Paddan Aram; and encamped before the city.  He
    bought the parcel of ground where he had spread
    his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor,
    Shechem's father, for one hundred pieces of money.
     He erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe
    Israel.
    
     Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to
    Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
     Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince
    of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her,
    and humbled her.  His soul joined to Dinah, the
    daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and
    spoke kindly to the young lady.  Shechem spoke to
    his father, Hamor, saying, 'Get me this young lady
    as a wife.'
     Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his
    daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the
    field. Jacob held his peace until they came. Hamor
    the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with
    him. The sons of Jacob came in from the field when
    they heard it. The men were grieved, and they were
    very angry, because he had done folly in Israel in
    lying with Jacob's daughter, a thing that ought not
    to be done.  Hamor talked with them, saying, 'The
    soul of my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter.
    Please give her to him as a wife.  Make marriages
    with us. Give your daughters to us, and take our
    daughters for yourselves. You shall dwell with us,
    and the land will be before you. Live and trade in it,
    and get possessions in it.'
     Shechem said to her father and to her brothers,
    'Let me find favor in your eyes, and whatever you
    will tell me I will give.  Ask me a great amount for
    a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but
    give me the young lady as a wife.'
     The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and
    Hamor his father with deceit when they spoke,
    because he had defiled Dinah their sister,  and said
    to them, 'We can't do this thing, to give our sister to
    one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to
    us.  Only on this condition will we consent to you.
    If you will be as we are, that every male of you be
    circumcised,  then will we give our daughters to
    you; and we will take your daughters to us, and we
    will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
     But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised,
    then we will take our sister,* and we will be gone.'
     Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem,
    Hamor's son.  The young man didn't wait to
    do this thing, because he had delight in Jacob's
    daughter, and he was honored above all the house
    of his father.  Hamor and Shechem, his son, came
    to the gate of their city, and talked with the men of
    their city, saying,  'These men are peaceful with
    us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade in
    it. For behold, the land is large enough for them.
    Let's take their daughters to us for wives, and let's
    give them our daughters.  Only on this condition
    will the men consent to us to live with us, to become
    one people, if every male among us is circumcised,
    as they are circumcised.  Won't their livestock
    and their possessions and all their animals be ours?
    Only let's give our consent to them, and they will
    dwell with us.'
    All who went out of the gate of his city listened
    to Hamor, and to Shechem his son; and every male
    was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his
    city.  On the third day, when they were sore, two
    of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers,
    each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting
    city, and killed all the males.  They killed Hamor
    and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword,
    and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went
    away.  Jacob's sons came on the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
     They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys,
    that which was in the city, that which was in the
    field,  and all their wealth. They took captive all
    their little ones and their wives, and took as plunder
    everything that was in the house.  Jacob said to
    Simeon and Levi, 'You have troubled me, to make
    me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the
    Canaanites and the Perizzites. I am few in number.
    They will gather themselves together against me
    and strike me, and I will be destroyed, I and my
    house.'
    
      
     They said, 'Should he deal with our sister as
    with a prostitute?'
    
     God said to Jacob, 'Arise, go up to Bethel,
    and live there. Make there an altar to God, who
    appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau
    your brother.'
     Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who
    were with him, 'Put away the foreign gods that
    are among you, purify yourselves, and change your
    garments.  Let's arise, and go up to Bethel. I will
    make there an altar to God, who answered me in
    the day of my distress, and was with me on the way
    which I went.'
     They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which
    were in their hands, and the rings which were in
    their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which
    was by Shechem.  They traveled, and a terror of
    God was on the cities that were around them, and
    they didn't pursue the sons of Jacob.  So Jacob
    came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land
    of Canaan, he and all the people who were with
    him.  He built an altar there, and called the place
    El Beth El; because there God was revealed to him,
    when he fled from the face of his brother. Deborah,
    Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried below
    Bethel under the oak; and its name was called Allon
    Bacuth.
     God appeared to Jacob again, when he came
    from Paddan Aram, and blessed him.  God said
    to him, 'Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not
    be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel.'
    He named him Israel.  God said to him, 'I am God
    Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a
    company of nations will be from you, and kings will
    come out of your body.  The land which I gave to
    Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your
    offspring after you I will give the land.'
     God went up from him in the place where he
    spoke with him.  Jacob set up a pillar in the place
    where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He
    poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on
    it.  Jacob called the name of the place where God
    spoke with him 'Bethel'.
     They traveled from Bethel. There was still
    some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel
    travailed. She had hard labor.  When she was in
    hard labor, the midwife said to her, 'Don't be afraid,
    for now you will have another son.'
     As her soul was departing (for she died), she
    named him Benoni,* but his father named him
    Benjamin.  Rachel died, and was buried on the
    way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).  Jacob set
    up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of
    Rachel's grave to this day.  Israel traveled, and
    spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.  While
    Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with
    Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard of it.
    Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.  The sons
    of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi,
    Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.  The sons of Rachel:
    Joseph and Benjamin. The sons of Bilhah (Rachel's
    servant): Dan and Naphtali.  The sons of Zilpah
    (Leah's servant): Gad and Asher. These are the
    sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan
    Aram.  Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre,
    to Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron), where Abraham
    and Isaac lived as foreigners.
     The days of Isaac were one hundred eighty
    years.  Isaac gave up the spirit and died, and was
    gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau and
    Jacob, his sons, buried him.
    
     Now this is the history of the generations of
    Esau (that is, Edom).  Esau took his wives from the
    daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon,
    the Hittite; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah,
    the daughter of Zibeon, the Hivite;  and Basemath,
    Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth.  Adah bore
    to Esau Eliphaz. Basemath bore Reuel. Oholibamah
    bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of
    Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
     Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and
    all the members of his household, with hislivestock,
    all his animals, and all his possessions, which he had
    gathered in the land of Canaan, and went into a land
    away from his brother Jacob.  For their substance
    was too great for them to dwell together, and the
    land of their travels couldn't bear them because of
    their livestock.  Esau lived in the hill country of
    Seir. Esau is Edom.
     This is the history of the generations of Esau
    the father of the Edomites in the hill country of
    Seir:  these are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz,
    the son of Adah, the wife of Esau; and Reuel, the
    son of Basemath, the wife of Esau.  The sons of
    Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and
    Kenaz.  Timna was concubine to Eliphaz, Esau's
    son; and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek. These are
    the descendants of Adah, Esau's wife.  These are
    the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and
    Mizzah. These were the descendants of Basemath,
    Esau's wife.  These were the sons of Oholibamah,
    the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon,
    Esau's wife: she bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and
    Korah.
     These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the
    sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau: chief Teman,
    chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,  chief Korah,
    chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are the chiefs
    who came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. These
    are the sons of Adah.  These are the sons of
    Reuel, Esau's son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief
    Shammah, chief Mizzah. These are the chiefs who
    came of Reuel in the land of Edom. These are the
    sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.  These are the
    sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife: chief Jeush, chief
    Jalam, chief Korah. These are the chiefs who came
    of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.
     These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and
    these are their chiefs.
     These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the
    inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon,
    
      
    Anah,  Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the
    chiefs who came of the Horites, the children of Seir
    in the land of Edom.  The children of Lotan were
    Hori and Heman. Lotan'ssister was Timna.  These
    are the children of Shobal: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal,
    Shepho, and Onam.  These are the children of
    Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is Anah who found the
    hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the donkeys
    of Zibeon his father.  These are the children
    of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah, the daughter
    of Anah.  These are the children of Dishon:
    Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.  These are
    the children of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
     These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
     These are the chiefs who came of the Horites:
    chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,
     chief Dishon, chief Ezer, and chief Dishan. These
    are the chiefs who came of the Horites, according to
    their chiefs in the land of Seir.
     These are the kings who reigned in the land of
    Edom, before any king reigned over the children of
    Israel.  Bela, the son of Beor, reigned in Edom.
    The name of his city was Dinhabah.  Bela died,
    and Jobab, the son of Zerah of Bozrah, reigned in
    his place.  Jobab died, and Husham of the land of
    the Temanites reigned in his place. Husham died,
    and Hadad, the son of Bedad, who struck Midian in
    the field of Moab, reigned in his place. The name
    of his city was Avith.  Hadad died, and Samlah of
    Masrekah reigned in his place.  Samlah died, and
    Shaul of Rehoboth by the river, reigned in his place.
     Shaul died, and Baal Hanan the son of Achbor
    reigned in his place. BaalHanan the son of Achbor
    died, and Hadar reigned in his place. The name of
    his city was Pau. His wife's name was Mehetabel,
    the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
     These are the names of the chiefs who came
    from Esau, according to their families, after their
    places, and by their names: chief Timna, chief
    Alvah, chief Jetheth,  chief Oholibamah, chief
    Elah, chief Pinon,  chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief
    Mibzar,  chief Magdiel, and chief Iram. These are
    the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in
    the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father
    of the Edomites.
    
     Jacob lived in the land of his father's travels,
    in the land of Canaan.  This is the history of the
    generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years
    old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. He was
    a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's
    wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to
    their father.  Now Israel loved Joseph more than
    all his children, because he was the son of his old
    age, and he made him a tunic of many colors.  His
    brothers saw that their father loved him more than
    all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn't
    speak peaceably to him.
     Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his
    brothers, and they hated him all the more.  He
    said to them, 'Please hear this dream which I have
    dreamed:  for behold, we were binding sheaves in
    the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood
    upright; and behold, your sheaves came around,
    and bowed down to my sheaf.'
     His brothers asked him, 'Will you indeed reign
    over us? Will you indeed have dominion over us?'
    They hated him all the more for his dreams and
    for his words.  He dreamed yet another dream,
    and told it to his brothers, and said, 'Behold, I
    have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the
    sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to
    me.'  He told it to his father and to his brothers.
    His father rebuked him, and said to him, 'What
    is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and
    your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow
    ourselves down to the earth before you?'  His
    brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying
    in mind.
     His brothers went to feed their father's flock
    in Shechem.  Israel said to Joseph, 'Aren't your
    brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I
    will send you to them.' He said to him, 'Here I am.'
     He said to him, 'Go now, see whether it is
    well with your brothers, and well with the flock;
    and bring me word again.' So he sent him out
    of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
     A certain man found him, and behold, he was
    wandering in the field. The man asked him, 'What
    are you looking for?'
    He said, 'I am looking for my brothers. Tell me,
    please, where they are feeding the flock.'
     The man said, 'They have left here, for I heard
    them say, 'Let's go to Dothan.' '
    Joseph went after his brothers, and found them
    in Dothan.  They saw him afar off, and before he
    came near to them, they conspired against him to
    kill him.  They said to one another, 'Behold, this
    dreamer comes.  Come now therefore, and let's
    kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we
    will say, 'An evil animal has devoured him.' We will
    see what will become of his dreams.'
     Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their
    hand, and said, 'Let's not take his life.'  Reuben
    said to them, 'Shed no blood. Throw him into this
    pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on
    him'-that he might deliver him out of their hand,
    to restore him to his father. When Joseph came to
    his brothers, they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the
    tunic of many colors that was on him;  and they
    took him, and threw him into the pit. The pit was
    empty. There was no water in it.
     They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted
    up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of
    Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their
    camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going
    to carry it down to Egypt.  Judah said to his
    brothers, 'What profit is it if we kill our brother and
    conceal his blood?  Come, and let's sell him to the
    Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on him; for he
    is our brother, our flesh.' His brothers listened to
    him.  Midianites who were merchants passed by,
    and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit,
    and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces
    of silver. The merchants brought Joseph into Egypt.
    Reuben returned to the pit, and saw thatJoseph
    wasn't in the pit; and he tore his clothes.  He
      
    returned to his brothers, and said, 'The child is no
    more; and I, where will I go?'  They took Joseph's
    tunic, and killed a male goat, and dipped the tunic
    in the blood.  They took the tunic of many colors,
    and they brought it to their father, and said, 'We
    have found this. Examine it, now, and see if it is your
    son's tunic or not.'
    He recognized it, and said, 'It is my son's tunic.
    An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph is without
    doubt torn in pieces.'  Jacob tore his clothes,
    and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for
    his son many days.  All his sons and all his
    daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to
    be comforted. He said, 'ForI will go down to Sheol*
    to my son, mourning.' His father wept for him.
     The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar,
    an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.
    
     At that time, Judah went down from his brothers,
    and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name
    was Hirah.  There, Judah saw the daughter of a
    certain Canaanite man named Shua. He took her,
    and went in to her.  She conceived, and bore a son;
    and he named him Er.  She conceived again, and
    bore a son; and she named him Onan. She yet again
    bore a son, and named him Shelah. He was at Chezib
    when she bore him.  Judah took a wife for Er, his
    firstborn, and her name was Tamar.  Er, Judah's
    firstborn, was wicked in Yahweh's sight. So Yahweh
    killed him.  Judah said to Onan, 'Go in to your
    brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's
    brother to her, and raise up offspring for your
    brother.'  Onan knew that the offspring wouldn't
    be his; and when he went in to his brother's wife,
    he spilled his semen on the ground, lest he should
    give offspring to his brother.  The thing which he
    did was evil in Yahweh's sight, and he killed him
    also.  Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in law,
    'Remain a widow in your father's house, until
    Shelah, my son, is grown up;' for he said, 'Lest he
    also die, like his brothers.' Tamar went and lived in
    her father's house.
     After many days, Shua's daughter, the wife of
    Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up
    to his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend
    Hirah, the Adullamite.  Tamar was told, 'Behold,
    your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear
    his sheep.'  She took off the garments of her
    widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and
    wrapped herself, and satin the gate of Enaim, which
    is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah
    was grown up, and she wasn't given to him as a
    wife.  When Judah saw her, he thought that she
    was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. He
    turned to her by the way, and said, 'Please come, let
    me come in to you,' for he didn't know that she was
    his daughter-in-law.
    She said, 'What will you give me, that you may
    come in to me?'
     He said, 'I will send you a young goat from the
    flock.'
    She said, 'Will you give me a pledge, until you
    send it?'
     He said, 'What pledge will I give you?'
    She said, 'Your signet and your cord, and your
    staff that is in your hand.'
    He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she
    conceived by him.  She arose, and went away, and
    put off her veil from her, and put on the garments
    of her widowhood.  Judah sent the young goat by
    the hand of his friend,the Adullamite,to receive the
    pledge from the woman's hand, but he didn't find
    her.  Then he asked the men of her place, saying,
    'Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the
    road?'
    They said, 'There has been no prostitute here.'
    He returned to Judah, and said, 'I haven't found
    her; and also the men of the place said, 'There has
    been no prostitute here.' '  Judah said, 'Let her
    keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this young
    goat, and you haven't found her.'
     About three months later, Judah was told,
    'Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute.
    Moreover, behold, she is with child by
    prostitution.'
    Judah said, 'Bring her out, and let her be
    burned.'  When she was brought out, she sent to
    her father-in-law, saying, 'I am with child by the
    man who owns these.' She also said, 'Please discern
    whose these are-the signet, and the cords, and the
    staff.'
     Judah acknowledged them, and said, 'She is
    more righteous than I, because I didn't give her to
    Shelah, my son.'
    He knew her again no more.  In the time of her
    travail, behold, twins were in her womb.  When
    she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife
    took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying,
    'This came out first.'  As he drew back his hand,
    behold, his brother came out, and she said, 'Why
    have you made a breach for yourself?' Therefore
    his name was called Perez.* Afterward his brother
    came out, who had the scarlet thread on his hand,
    and his name was called Zerah.
    
     Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar,
    an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard,
    an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the
    Ishmaelites that had brought him down there.
     Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man.
    He was in the house of his master the
    Egyptian.  His master saw that Yahweh was with
    him, and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper
    in his hand.  Joseph found favor in his sight. He
    ministered to him, and Potiphar made him overseer
    over his house, and all that he had he put into his
    hand.  From the time that he made him overseer in
    his house, and over all that he had, Yahweh blessed
    the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake. Yahweh's
    blessing was on all that he had, in the house and in
    the field.  He left all that he had in Joseph's hand.
    
      
    He didn't concern himself with anything, except for
    the food which he ate.
    Joseph was well-built and handsome.  After
    these things, his master's wife set her eyes on
    Joseph; and she said, 'Lie with me.'
     But he refused, and said to his master's wife,
    'Behold, my master doesn't know what is with me
    in the house, and he has put all that he has into my
    hand.  No one is greater in this house than I am,
    and he has not kept back anything from me but you,
    because you are his wife. How then can I do this
    great wickedness, and sin against God?'
     As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn't
    listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her. About
    this time, he went into the house to do his work,
    and there were none of the men of the house inside.
     She caught him by his garment, saying, 'Lie with
    me!'
    He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside.
     When she saw that he had left his garment in her
    hand, and had run outside,  she called to the men
    of her house, and spoke to them, saying, 'Behold,
    he has brought a Hebrew in to us to mock us. He
    came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a
    loud voice.  When he heard that I lifted up my
    voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran
    outside.'  She laid up his garment by her, until his
    master came home.  She spoke to him according
    to these words,saying, 'The Hebrew servant, whom
    you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,
     and as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his
    garment by me, and ran outside.'
     When his master heard the words of his wife,
    which she spoke to him, saying, 'This is what
    your servant did to me,' his wrath was kindled.
     Joseph's master took him, and put him into the
    prison, the place where the king's prisoners were
    bound, and he was there in custody.  But Yahweh
    was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and
    gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the
    prison.  The keeper of the prison committed to
    Joseph's hand all the prisoners who were in the
    prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible
    for it.  The keeper of the prison didn't look after
    anything that was under his hand, because Yahweh
    was with him; and that which he did, Yahweh made
    it prosper.
    
     After these things, the butler of the king of
    Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of
    Egypt.  Pharaoh was angry with his two officers,
    the chief cup bearer and the chief baker.  He
    put them in custody in the house of the captain of
    the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph
    was bound.  The captain of the guard assigned
    them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They
    stayed in prison many days.  They both dreamed a
    dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man
    according to the interpretation of his dream, the
    cup bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who
    were bound in the prison.  Joseph came in to them
    in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they
    were sad.  He asked Pharaoh's officers who were
    with him in custody in his master's house, saying,
    'Why do you look so sad today?'
     They said to him, 'We have dreamed a dream,
    and there is no one who can interpret it.'
    Joseph said to them, 'Don't interpretations belong to God?
    Please tell it to me.'
     The chief cup bearer told his dream to Joseph,
    and said to him, 'In my dream, behold, a vine was in
    front of me,  and in the vine were three branches.
    It was as though it budded, it blossomed, and its
    clusters produced ripe grapes.  Pharaoh's cup was
    in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed
    them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into
    Pharaoh's hand.'
     Joseph said to him, 'This is its interpretation:
    the three branches are three days.  Within three
    more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and
    restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh's
    cup into his hand, the way you did when you were
    his cup bearer.  But remember me when it is well
    with you. Please show kindness to me, and make
    mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring me out of
    this house.  For indeed, I was stolen away out of
    the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done
    nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.'
     When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good,
    he said to Joseph, 'I also was in
    my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread
    were on my head.  In the uppermost basket there
    were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the
    birds ate them out of the basket on my head.'
     Joseph answered, 'This is its interpretation.
    The three baskets are three days.  Within three
    more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off
    you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will
    eat your flesh from off you.'  On the third day,
    which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for
    all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the
    chief cup bearer and the head of the chief baker
    among his servants.  He restored the chief cup
    bearer to his position again, and he gave the cup
    into Pharaoh's hand;  but he hanged the chief
    baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.  Yet the
    chief cup bearer didn't remember Joseph, but forgot
    him.
    
     At the end of two full years, Pharaoh dreamed,
    and behold, he stood by the river.  Behold, seven
    cattle came up out of the river. They were sleek and
    fat, and they fed in the marsh grass.  Behold, seven
    other cattle came up after them out of the river,
    ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the
    brink of the river.  The ugly and thin cattle ate up
    the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke.
     He slept and dreamed a second time; and behold,
    seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy
    and good.  Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and
    blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
     The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven
    healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold,
    it was a dream.  In the morning, his spirit was
    troubled, and he sent and called for all of Egypt's
    magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his
      
    dreams, but there was no one who could interpret
    them to Pharaoh.
     Then the chief cup bearer spoke to Pharaoh,
    saying, 'I remember my faults today.  Pharaoh
    was angry with his servants, and put me in custody
    in the house of the captain of the guard, with
    the chief baker.  We dreamed a dream in one
    night, he and I. Each man dreamed according to the
    interpretation of his dream.  There was with us
    there a young man, a Hebrew,servant to the captain
    of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted
    to us our dreams. He interpreted to each man
    according to his dream. As he interpreted to us,so
    it was. He restored me to my office, and he hanged
    him.'
     Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and
    they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He
    shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came
    in to Pharaoh.  Pharaoh said to Joseph, 'I have
    dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can
    interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when
    you hear a dream you can interpret it.'
     Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, 'It isn't in
    me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.'
     Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, 'In my dream, behold,
    I stood on the brink of the river;  and behold,
    seven fat and sleek cattle came up out of the river.
    They fed in the marsh grass;  and behold, seven
    other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly
    and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt
    for ugliness.  The thin and ugly cattle ate up the
    first seven fat cattle;  and when they had eaten
    them up, it couldn't be known that they had eaten
    them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning.
    So I awoke.  I saw in my dream, and behold, seven
    heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good;
     and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin,
    and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after
    them.  The thin heads of grain swallowed up the
    seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians,
    but there was no one who could explain it to me.'
     Joseph said to Pharaoh, 'The dream of Pharaoh
    is one. What God is about to do he has declared to
    Pharaoh.  The seven good cattle are seven years;
    and the seven good heads of grain are seven years.
    The dream is one.  The seven thin and ugly cattle
    that came up after them are seven years, and also
    the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east
    wind; they will be seven years of famine.  That is
    the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has
    shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.  Behold,
    seven years of great plenty throughout all the land
    of Egypt are coming.  Seven years of famine will
    arise after them, and all the plenty will be forgotten
    in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the
    land,  and the plenty will not be known in the
    land by reason of that famine which follows; for it
    will be very grievous.  The dream was doubled to
    Pharaoh, because the thing is established by God,
    and God will shortly bring it to pass.
     'Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet
    and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt.
    Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers
    over the land, and take up the fifth part of the
    land of Egypt's produce in the seven plenteous
    years.  Let them gather all the food of these good
    years that come, and store grain under the hand of
    Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
     The food will be to supply the land against the
    seven years of famine, which will be in the land of
    Egypt; so that the land will not perish through the
    famine.'
     The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh,
    and in the eyes of all his servants.  Pharaoh said
    to his servants, 'Can we find such a one as this,
    a man in whom is the Spirit of God?'  Pharaoh
    said to Joseph, 'Because God has shown you all of
    this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you.
     You shall be over my house. All my people will be
    ruled according to your word. Only in the throne
    I will be greater than you.'  Pharaoh said to
    Joseph, 'Behold, I have set you over all the land
    of Egypt.'  Pharaoh took off his signet ring from
    his hand, and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed
    him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain
    about his neck.  He made him ride in the second
    chariot which he had. They cried before him, 'Bow
    the knee!' He set him over all the land of Egypt.
     Pharaoh said to Joseph, 'I am Pharaoh. Without
    you, no man shall lift up his hand or his foot in
    all the land of Egypt.'  Pharaoh called Joseph's
    name Zaphenath-Paneah. He gave him Asenath,the
    daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph
    went out over the land of Egypt.
     Joseph was thirty years old when he stood
    before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from
    the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all
    the land of Egypt.  In the seven plenteous years
    the earth produced abundantly.  He gathered up
    all the food of the seven years which were in the
    land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities. He
    stored food in each city from the fields around that
    city.  Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea,
    very much, until he stopped counting, for it was
    without number.  To Joseph were born two sons
    before the year of famine came, whom Asenath,
    the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to
    him.  Joseph called the name of the firstborn
    Manasseh,* 'For', he said, 'God has made me forget
    all my toil, and all my father's house.'  The name
    of the second, he called Ephraim: 'For God has
    made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.'
     The seven years of plenty, that were in the
    land of Egypt, came to an end.  The seven years
    of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said.
    There was famine in all lands, but in all the land
    of Egypt there was bread.  When all the land of
    Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for
    bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, 'Go to
    Joseph. What he says to you, do.'  The famine
    was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened
    all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians.
    The famine was severe in the land of Egypt.  All
    
      
    countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain,
    because the famine was severe in all the earth.
    
     Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt,
    and Jacob said to his sons, 'Why do you look at
    one another?'  He said, 'Behold, I have heard
    that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and
    buy for us from there, so that we may live, and
    not die.'  Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy
    grain from Egypt.  But Jacob didn't send Benjamin,
    Joseph's brother, with his brothers; for he said,
    'Lest perhaps harm happen to him.'  The sons
    of Israel came to buy among those who came, for
    the famine was in the land of Canaan.  Joseph was
    the governor over the land. It was he who sold to
    all the people of the land. Joseph's brothers came,
    and bowed themselves down to him with their faces
    to the earth.  Joseph saw his brothers, and he
    recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them,
    and spoke roughly with them. He said to them,
    'Where did you come from?'
    They said, 'From the land of Canaan, to buy
    food.'
     Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn't
    recognize him.  Joseph remembered the dreams
    which he dreamed about them, and said to them,
    'You are spies! You have come to see the nakedness
    of the land.'
     They said to him, 'No, my lord, but your
    servants have come to buy food.  We are all one
    man's sons; we are honest men. Your servants are
    not spies.'
    He said to them, 'No, but you have come to see
    the nakedness of the land!'
     They said, 'We, your servants, are twelve
    brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan;
    and behold, the youngest is today with our father,
    and one is no more.'
     Joseph said to them, 'It is like I told you,saying,
    'You are spies!'  By this you shall be tested. By
    the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here,
    unless your youngest brother comes here.  Send
    one of you, and let him get your brother, and you
    shall be bound, that your words may be tested,
    whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of
    Pharaoh surely you are spies.'  He put them all
    together into custody for three days.
     Joseph said to them the third day, 'Do this, and
    live, forI fear God.  If you are honest men, then let
    one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but
    you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses.
     Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your
    words be verified, and you won't die.'
    They did so.  They said to one another, 'We
    are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that
    we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged
    us, and we wouldn't listen. Therefore this distress
    has come upon us.'  Reuben answered them,
    saying, 'Didn't I tell you, saying, 'Don't sin against
    the child,' and you wouldn't listen? Therefore also,
    behold, his blood is required.'  They didn't know
    that Joseph understood them; for there was an
    interpreter between them.  He turned himself
    away from them, and wept. Then he returned to
    them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from
    among them, and bound him before their eyes.
     Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags
    with grain, and to restore each man's money into
    his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it
    was done to them.
     They loaded their donkeys with their grain,
    and departed from there.  As one of them opened
    his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging
    place, he saw his money. Behold, it was in the
    mouth of his sack.  He said to his brothers, 'My
    money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!' Their
    hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to
    one another,saying, 'What is this that God has done
    to us?'  They came to Jacob their father, to the
    land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened
    to them, saying,  'The man, the lord of the land,
    spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the
    country.  We said to him, 'We are honest men.
    We are no spies.  We are twelve brothers, sons
    of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is
    today with our father in the land of Canaan.'  The
    man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I will
    know that you are honest men: leave one of your
    brothers with me, and take grain for the famine
    of your houses, and go your way.  Bring your
    youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you
    are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will
    deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in
    the land.' '
    As they emptied their sacks, behold, each man's
    bundle of money was in his sack. When they and
    their father saw their bundles of money, they were
    afraid.  Jacob, their father,said to them, 'You have
    bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more,
    Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin
    away. All these things are against me.'
    Reuben spoke to his father,saying, 'Kill my two
    sons, if I don't bring him to you. Entrust him to my
    care, and I will bring him to you again.'
     He said, 'My son shall not go down with you;
    for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm
    happens to him along the way in which you go, then
    you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to
    Sheol.'*
    
     The famine was severe in the land.  When they
    had eaten up the grain which they had brought out
    of Egypt, their father said to them, 'Go again, buy
    us a little more food.'
     Judah spoke to him, saying, 'The man solemnly
    warned us,saying, 'You shall not see my face, unless
    your brother is with you.'  If you'll send our brother
    with us, we'll go down and buy you food;  but if you
    don't send him, we won't go down, for the man said
    to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother
    is with you.' '
     Israel said, 'Why did you treat me so badly,
    telling the man that you had another brother?'

      
     They said, 'The man asked directly concerning
    ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, 'Is
    your father still alive? Have you another brother?'
    We just answered his questions. Is there any way we
    could know that he would say, 'Bring your brother
    down?' '
     Judah said to Israel, his father, 'Send the boy
    with me, and we'll get up and go, so that we may
    live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our
    little ones.  I'll be collateral for him. From my hand
    will you require him. If I don't bring him to you,
    and set him before you, then let me bear the blame
    forever;  for if we hadn't delayed, surely we would
    have returned a second time by now.'
     Their father, Israel, said to them, 'If it must
    be so, then do this: Take from the choice fruits of
    the land in your bags, and carry down a present
    for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices
    and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;  and take double
    money in your hand, and take back the money that
    was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps
    it was an oversight.  Take your brother also, get
    up, and return to the man.  May God Almighty
    give you mercy before the man, that he may release
    to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am
    bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.'
     The men took that present, and they took
    double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got
    up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
     When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to
    the steward of his house, 'Bring the men into the
    house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the
    men will dine with me at noon.'
     The man did as Joseph commanded, and the
    man brought the men to Joseph's house. The men
    were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's
    house; and they said, 'Because of the money that
    was returned in our sacks the first time, we're
    brought in; that he may seek occasion against us,
    attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our
    donkeys.'  They came near to the steward of
    Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the door
    of the house,  and said, 'Oh, my lord, we indeed
    came down the first time to buy food.  When we
    came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and
    behold, each man's money was in the mouth of his
    sack, our money in full weight. We have brought
    it back in our hand.  We have brought down other
    money in our hand to buy food. We don't know who
    put our money in our sacks.'
     He said, 'Peace be to you. Don't be afraid.
    Your God, and the God of your father, has given you
    treasure in your sacks. I received your money.' He
    brought Simeon out to them.  The man brought
    the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water,
    and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys
    fodder.  They prepared the present for Joseph's
    coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat
    bread there.
    When Joseph came home,they brought him the
    present which was in their hand into the house, and
    bowed themselves down to the earth before him.
    He asked them of their welfare, and said, 'Is your
    father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he
    yet alive?'
     They said, 'Your servant, our father, is well.
    He is still alive.' They bowed down humbly.  He
    lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother,
    his mother's son, and said, 'Is this your youngest
    brother, of whom you spoke to me?' He said, 'God
    be gracious to you, my son.'  Joseph hurried, for
    his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a
    place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept
    there.  He washed his face, and came out. He
    controlled himself, and said, 'Serve the meal.'
     They served him by himself, and them by
    themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by
    themselves, because the Egyptians don't eat with
    the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the
    Egyptians.  They sat before him, the firstborn
    according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth,
    and the men marveled with
    one another.  He sent portions to them from
    before him, but Benjamin's portion was five times as
    much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry
    with him.
    
    He commanded the steward of his house,saying,
    'Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they
    can carry, and put each man's money in his sack's
    mouth.  Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's
    mouth of the youngest, with his grain money.' He
    did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
     As soon as the morning was light, the men were
    sent away, they and their donkeys.  When they
    had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off,
    Joseph said to his steward, 'Up, follow after the
    men. When you overtake them, ask them, 'Why
    have you rewarded evil for good?  Isn't this that
    from which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed
    divines? You have done evil in so doing.' '  He
    overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.
     They said to him, 'Why does my lord speak
    such words as these? Far be it from your servants
    that they should do such a thing!  Behold, the
    money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we
    brought again to you out of the land of Canaan.
    How then should we steal silver or gold out of your
    lord's house?  With whomever of your servants it
    is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's
    slaves.'
     He said, 'Now also let it be according to your
    words. He with whom it is found will be my slave;
    and you will be blameless.'
     Then they hurried, and each man took his
    sack down to the ground, and each man opened
    his sack.  He searched, beginning with the oldest,
    and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in
    Benjamin's sack. Then they tore their clothes, and
    each man loaded his donkey, and returned to the
    city.
     Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house,
    and he was still there. They fell on the ground
    before him.  Joseph said to them, 'What deed is
    this that you have done? Don't you know that such
    a man as I can indeed do divination?'
      
     Judah said, 'What will we tell my lord? What
    will we speak? How will we clear ourselves? God has
    found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we
    are my lord's slaves, both we and he also in whose
    hand the cup is found.'
     He said, 'Far be it from me that I should do so.
    The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will
    be my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your
    father.'
     Then Judah came near to him, and said, 'Oh,
    my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my
    lord's ears, and don't let your anger burn against
    your servant; for you are even as Pharaoh.  My
    lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father,
    or a brother?'  We said to my lord, 'We have a
    father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a
    little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone
    is left of his mother; and his father loves him.'
     You said to your servants, 'Bring him down to
    me, that I may set my eyes on him.'  We said
    to my lord, 'The boy can't leave his father, for if
    he should leave his father, his father would die.'
     You said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest
    brother comes down with you, you will see my face
    no more.'  When we came up to your servant my
    father, we told him the words of my lord.  Our
    father said, 'Go again and buy us a little food.'  We
    said, 'We can't go down. If our youngest brother is
    with us, then we will go down: for we may not see
    the man's face, unless our youngest brother is with
    us.' Your servant, my father,said to us, 'You know
    that my wife bore me two sons. One went out from
    me, and I said, 'Surely he is torn in pieces;' and I
    haven't seen him since.  If you take this one also
    from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring
    down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.'*  Now
    therefore when I come to your servant my father,
    and the boy is not with us; since his life is bound up
    in the boy's life;  it will happen, when he sees that
    the boy is no more, that he will die. Your servants
    will bring down the gray hairs of your servant, our
    father, with sorrow to Sheol.  For your servant
    became collateral for the boy to my father, saying,
    'IfI don't bring him to you,then I will bear the blame
    to my father forever.'  Now therefore, please let
    your servant stay instead of the boy, my lord's slave;
    and let the boy go up with his brothers.  For how
    will I go up to my father, if the boy isn't with me?
    -lest I see the evil that will come on my father.'
    
     Then Joseph couldn't control himself before all
    those who stood before him, and he called out,
    'Cause everyone to go out from me!' No one else
    stood with him, while Joseph made himself known
    to his brothers.  He wept aloud. The Egyptians
    heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.  Joseph
    said to his brothers, 'I am Joseph! Does my father
    still live?'
    His brothers couldn't answer him; for they were
    terrified at his presence.  Joseph said to his brothers,
    'Come near to me, please.'
    They came near. He said, 'I am Joseph, your
    brother, whom you sold into Egypt.  Now don't be
    grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold
    me here, for God sent me before you to preserve
    life.  For these two years the famine has been in the
    land, and there are yet five years, in which there will
    be no plowing and no harvest.  God sent me before
    you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and
    to save you alive by a great deliverance.  So now it
    wasn't you who sent me here, but God, and he has
    made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house,
    and ruler over all the land of Egypt.  Hurry, and
    go up to my father, and tell him, 'This is what your
    son Joseph says, 'God has made me lord of all Egypt.
    Come down to me. Don't wait.  You shall dwell
    in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me,
    you, your children, your children's children, your
    flocks, your herds, and all that you have.  There
    I will provide for you; for there are yet five years
    of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your
    household, and all that you have.' '  Behold, your
    eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that
    it is my mouth that speaks to you.  You shall tell
    my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that
    you have seen. You shall hurry and bring my father
    down here.'  He fell on his brother Benjamin's
    neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck.
     He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them.
    After that his brothers talked with him.
     The report of it was heard in Pharaoh's house,
    saying, 'Joseph's brothers have come.' It pleased
    Pharaoh well, and his servants.  Pharaoh said
    to Joseph, 'Tell your brothers, 'Do this: Load your
    animals, and go,travel to the land of Canaan. Take
    your father and your households, and come to me,
    and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt,
    and you will eat the fat of the land.'  Now you are
    commanded to do this: Take wagons out of the land
    of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and
    bring your father, and come.  Also, don't concern
    yourselves about your belongings, for the good of
    all the land of Egypt is yours.'
    The sons ofIsrael did so. Joseph gave them wagons,
    according to the commandment of Pharaoh,
    and gave them provision for the way.  He gave
    each one of them changes of clothing,
    but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and
    five changes of clothing.  He sent the following to
    his father: ten donkeys loaded with the good things
    of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain
    and bread and provision for his father by the way.
     So he sent his brothers away, and they departed.
    He said to them, 'See that you don't quarrel on the
    way.'
     They went up out of Egypt, and came into the
    land of Canaan, to Jacob their father.  They told
    him, saying, 'Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler
    over all the land of Egypt.' His heart fainted, for he
    didn't believe them.  They told him all the words
    of Joseph, which he had said to them. When he saw
    the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the
    spirit of Jacob, their father, revived.  Israel said,
    
      
    'It is enough. Joseph my son is still alive. I will go
    and see him before I die.'
    
     Israel traveled with all that he had, and came to
    Beersheba, and offered sacrifices to the God of his
    father, Isaac.  God spoke to Israel in the visions of
    the night, and said, 'Jacob, Jacob!'
    He said, 'Here I am.'
    He said, 'I am God, the God of your father. Don't
    be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make
    of you a great nation.  I will go down with you into
    Egypt. I will also surely bring you up again. Joseph's
    hand will close your eyes.'
     Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of
    Israel carried Jacob, their father, their little ones,
    and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had
    sent to carry him.  They took their livestock, and
    their goods, which they had gotten in the land of
    Canaan, and came into Egypt -Jacob, and all his
    offspring with him,  his sons, and his sons' sons
    with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters,
    and he brought all his offspring with him into Egypt.
     These are the names of the children of Israel,
    who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben,
    Jacob's firstborn.  The sons of Reuben: Hanoch,
    Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.  The sons of Simeon:
    Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the
    son of a Canaanite woman.  The sons of Levi:
    Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.  The sons of Judah:
    Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan
    died in the land of Canaan. The sons of Perez were
    Hezron and Hamul.  The sons of Issachar: Tola,
    Puvah, Iob, and Shimron.  The sons of Zebulun:
    Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.  These are the sons of
    Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with
    his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and
    his daughters were thirty-three.  The sons of Gad:
    Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
     The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah,
    and Serah their sister. The sons of Beriah: Heber
    and Malchiel.  These are the sons of Zilpah, whom
    Laban gave to Leah, his daughter, and these she bore
    to Jacob, even sixteen souls.  The sons of Rachel,
    Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.  To Joseph in
    the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim,
    whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest
    of On, bore to him.  The sons of Benjamin: Bela,
    Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim,
    Huppim, and Ard.  These are the sons of Rachel,
    who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.
     The son of Dan: Hushim.  The sons of Naphtali:
    Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.  These are
    the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel,
    his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob: all the
    souls were seven.  All the souls who came with
    Jacob into Egypt, who were his direct offspring, in
    addition to Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were
    sixty-six.  The sons of Joseph, who were born to
    him in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the
    house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy.
     Jacob sent Judah before him to Joseph, to show
    the way before him to Goshen, and they came into
    the land of Goshen.  Joseph prepared his chariot,
    and went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen.
    He presented himself to him, and fell on his neck,
    and wept on his neck a good while.  Israel said to
    Joseph, 'Now let me die,since I have seen your face,
    that you are still alive.'
     Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father's
    house, 'I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and
    will tell him, 'My brothers, and my father's house,
    who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.
     These men are shepherds, for they have been
    keepers of livestock, and they have brought their
    flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.'  It
    will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will
    say, 'What is your occupation?'  that you shall say,
    'Your servants have been keepers of livestock from
    our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers:'
    that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every
    shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.'
    
    Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said,
    'My father and my brothers, with their flocks, their
    herds, and all that they own, have come out of the
    land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of
    Goshen.'  From among his brothers he took five
    men, and presented them to Pharaoh.  Pharaoh
    said to his brothers, 'What is your occupation?'
    They said to Pharaoh, 'Your servants are shepherds,
    both we, and our fathers.'  They also said
    to Pharaoh, 'We have come to live as foreigners in
    the land, for there is no pasture for your servants'
    flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of
    Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants
    dwell in the land of Goshen.'
     Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, 'Your father
    and your brothers have come to you.  The land
    of Egypt is before you. Make your father and your
    brothers dwell in the best of the land. Let them
    dwell in the land of Goshen. If you know any able
    men among them, then put them in charge of my
    livestock.'
     Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set
    him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
     Pharaoh said to Jacob, 'How old are you?'
     Jacob said to Pharaoh, 'The years of my pilgrimage
    are one hundred thirty years. The days of the
    years of my life have been few and evil. They have
    not attained to the days of the years of the life of
    my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.'  Jacob
    blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of
    Pharaoh.
     Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and
    gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the
    best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh
    had commanded.  Joseph provided his father,
    his brothers, and all of his father's household with
    bread, according to the sizes of their families.
     There was no bread in all the land; for the
    famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt
    and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the
    famine.  Joseph gathered up all the money that
    was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land
    of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and
    Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
      
     When the money was all spent in the land of
    Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians
    came to Joseph, and said, 'Give us bread, for why
    should we die in your presence? For our money
    fails.'
     Joseph said, 'Give me your livestock; and I will
    give you food for your livestock, if your money is
    gone.'
     They brought their livestock to Joseph, and
    Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses,
    and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the
    donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange
    for all their livestock for that year.  When that
    year was ended, they came to him the second year,
    and said to him, 'We will not hide from my lord how
    our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock
    are my lord's. There is nothing left in the sight
    of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands.  Why
    should we die before your eyes, both we and our
    land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our
    land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that
    we may live, and not die, and that the land won't be
    desolate.'
     So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for
    Pharaoh, for every man of the Egyptians sold his
    field, because the famine was severe on them, and
    the land became Pharaoh's.  As for the people,
    he moved them to the cities from one end of the
    border of Egypt even to the other end of it.  Only
    he didn't buy the land of the priests, for the priests
    had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion
    which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn't
    sell their land.  Then Joseph said to the people,
    'Behold, I have bought you and your land today for
    Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall
    sow the land.  It will happen at the harvests, that
    you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will
    be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for
    them of your households, and for food for your little
    ones.'
     They said, 'You have saved our lives! Let us
    find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be
    Pharaoh's servants.'
     Joseph made it a statute concerning the land
    of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the
    fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn't
    become Pharaoh's.
     Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land
    of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions
    therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.
    Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen
    years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life,
    were one hundred forty-seven years.  The time
    came near that Israel must die, and he called his son
    Joseph, and said to him, 'If now I have found favor
    in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh,
    and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don't bury
    me in Egypt, but when I sleep with my fathers, you
    shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their
    burying place.'
    Joseph said, 'I will do as you have said.'
     Israel said, 'Swear to me,' and he swore to him.
    Then Israel bowed himself on the bed's head.
    
     After these things, someone said to Joseph,
    'Behold, your father is sick.' He took with him his
    two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.  Someone told
    Jacob, and said, 'Behold, your son Joseph comes
    to you,' and Israel strengthened himself, and sat
    on the bed.  Jacob said to Joseph, 'God Almighty
    appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and
    blessed me,  and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you
    fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a
    company of peoples, and will give this land to your
    offspring after you for an everlasting possession.'
     Now your two sons, who were born to you in the
    land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are
    mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and
    Simeon, will be mine.  Your offspring, whom you
    become the father of after them, will be yours. They
    will be called after the name of their brothers in
    their inheritance.  As for me, when I came from
    Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan
    on the way, when there was still some distance to
    come to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way
    to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).'
     Israel saw Joseph's sons, and said, 'Who are
    these?'
     Joseph said to his father, 'They are my sons,
    whom God has given me here.'
    He said, 'Please bring them to me, and I will bless
    them.'  Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age,
    so that he couldn't see well. Joseph brought them
    near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced
    them.  Israel said to Joseph, 'I didn't think I
    would see your face, and behold, God has let me
    see your offspring also.'  Joseph brought them
    out from between his knees, and he bowed himself
    with his face to the earth.  Joseph took them
    both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's
    left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward
    Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.
     Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it
    on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his
    left hand on Manasseh's head, guiding his hands
    knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn.  He
    blessed Joseph, and said,
    'The God before whom my fathers Abraham and
    Isaac walked,
    the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,
     the angel who has redeemed me from all evil,
    bless the lads,
    and let my name be named on them,
    and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac.
    Let them grow into a multitude upon the earth.'
     When Joseph saw that his father laid his right
    hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him.
    He held up his father's hand, to remove it from
    Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.  Joseph said
    to his father, 'Not so, my father, for this is the
    firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.'
     His father refused, and said, 'I know, my son,
    I know. He also will become a people, and he also
    will be great. However, his younger brother will
    be greater than he, and his offspring will become a
    multitude of nations.'  He blessed them that day,
    saying, 'Israel will bless in you, saying, 'God make
      
    you as Ephraim and as Manasseh' ' He set Ephraim
    before Manasseh.  Israel said to Joseph, 'Behold,
    I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring
    you again to the land of your fathers.  Moreover I
    have given to you one portion above your brothers,
    which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my
    sword and with my bow.'
    
     Jacob called to his sons, and said: 'Gather
    yourselves together, that I may tell you that which
    will happen to you in the days to come.
     Assemble yourselves, and hear, you sons of Jacob.
    Listen to Israel, your father.
     'Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the
    beginning of my strength,
    excelling in dignity, and excelling in power.
     Boiling over like water, you shall not excel,
    because you went up to your father's bed,
    then defiled it. He went up to my couch.
     'Simeon and Levi are brothers.
    Their swords are weapons of violence.
     My soul, don't come into their council.
    My glory, don't be united to their assembly;
    for in their anger they killed men.
    In their self-will they hamstrung cattle.
     Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;
    and their wrath, for it was cruel.
    I will divide them in Jacob,
    and scatter them in Israel.
     'Judah, your brothers will praise you.
    Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies.
    Your father's sons will bow down before you.
     Judah is a lion's cub.
    From the prey, my son, you have gone up.
    He stooped down, he crouched as a lion,
    as a lioness.
    Who will rouse him up?
     The scepter will not depart from Judah,
    nor the ruler's staff from between his feet,
    until he comes to whom it belongs.
    The obedience of the peoples will be to him.
     Binding his foal to the vine,
    his donkey's colt to the choice vine,
    he has washed his garments in wine,
    his robes in the blood of grapes.
     His eyes will be red with wine,
    his teeth white with milk.
     'Zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea.
    He will be for a haven of ships.
    His border will be on Sidon.
     'Issachar is a strong donkey,
    lying down between the saddlebags.
     He saw a resting place, that it was good,
    the land, that it was pleasant.
    He bows his shoulder to the burden,
    and becomes a servant doing forced labor.
     'Dan will judge his people,
    as one of the tribes of Israel.
     Dan will be a serpent on the trail,
    an adder in the path,
    that bites the horse's heels,
    so that his rider falls backward.
     I have waited for your salvation, Yahweh.
     'A troop will press on Gad,
    but he will press on their heel.
     'Asher's food will be rich.
    He will produce royal dainties.
     'Naphtali is a doe set free,
    who bears beautiful fawns.
     'Joseph is a fruitful vine,
    a fruitful vine by a spring.
    His branches run over the wall.
     The archers have severely grieved him,
    shot at him, and persecuted him:
     But his bow remained strong.
    The arms of his hands were made strong,
    by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob,
    (from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),
     even by the God of your father, who will help you,
    by the Almighty, who will bless you,
    with blessings of heaven above,
    blessings of the deep that lies below,
    blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.
     The blessings of your father have prevailed above
    the blessings of my ancestors,
    above the boundaries of the ancient hills.
    They will be on the head of Joseph,
    on the crown of the head of him who is separated from his brothers.
     'Benjamin is a ravenous wolf.
    In the morning he will devour the prey.
    At evening he will divide the plunder.'
     All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and
    this is what their father spoke to them, and blessed
    them. He blessed everyone according to his own
    blessing.  He instructed them, and said to them,
    'I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with
    my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron
    the Hittite,  in the cave that is in the field of
    Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land
    of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field
    from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place.  There
    they buried Abraham and Sarah, his wife. There
    they buried Isaac and Rebekah, his wife, and there
    I buried Leah:  the field and the cave that is
    therein, which was purchased from the children of
    Heth.'  When Jacob finished charging his sons, he
    gathered up his feet into the bed, breathed his last
    breath, and was gathered to his people.
    
     Joseph fell on his father's face, wept on him,
    and kissed him.  Joseph commanded his servants,
    the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel.
    Forty days were used for
    him, for that is how many days it takes to embalm.
    The Egyptians wept for Israel for seventy days.
      
     When the days of weeping for him were past,
    Joseph spoke to Pharaoh's staff, saying, 'If now
    I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in
    the ears of Pharaoh, saying,  'My father made me
    swear, saying, 'Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my
    grave which I have dug for myself in the land of
    Canaan.' Now therefore, please let me go up and
    bury my father, and I will come again.' '
     Pharaoh said, 'Go up, and bury your father, just
    like he made you swear.'
     Joseph went up to bury his father; and with
    him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders
    of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt,
     all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his
    father's house. Only their little ones, their flocks,
    and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
     Both chariots and horsemen went up with him.
    It was a very great company.  They came to
    the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the
    Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great
    and severe lamentation. He mourned for his father
    seven days.  When the inhabitants of the land,
    the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of
    Atad, they said, 'This is a grievous mourning by
    the Egyptians.' Therefore its name was called Abel
    Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.  His sons
    did to him just as he commanded them,  for his
    sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried
    him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which
    Abraham bought with the field, as a possession for
    a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, near Mamre.
     Joseph returned into Egypt-he, and his brothers,
    and all that went up with him to bury his father,
    after he had buried his father.
     When Joseph's brothers saw that their father
    was dead, they said, 'It may be that Joseph will
    hate us, and will fully pay us back for all the evil
    which we did to him.'  They sent a message to
    Joseph, saying, 'Your father commanded before he
    died, saying,  'You shall tell Joseph, 'Now please
    forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and their
    sin, because they did evil to you.' ' Now, please
    forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God
    of your father.' Joseph wept when they spoke
    to him.  His brothers also went and fell down
    before his face; and they said, 'Behold, we are your
    servants.'  Joseph said to them, 'Don't be afraid,
    for am I in the place of God? as for you, you meant
    evil against me, but God meant it for good, to save
    many people alive, as is happening today.  Now
    therefore don't be afraid. I will provide for you and
    your little ones.' He comforted them, and spoke
    kindly to them.
     Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father's
    house. Joseph lived one hundred ten years.
     Joseph saw Ephraim's children to the third generation.
    The children also of Machir, the son of
    Manasseh, were born on Joseph's knees.  Joseph
    said to his brothers, 'I am dying, but God will surely
    visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the
    land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
    Jacob.'  Joseph took an oath from the children of
    Israel, saying, 'God will surely visit you, and you
    shall carry up my bones from here.'  So Joseph
    died, being one hundred ten years old, and they
    embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
      
    The Second Book of Moses,
    Commonly Called
    Exodus:

     Now these are the names of the sons of Israel,
    who came into Egypt (every man and his household
    came with Jacob):  Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and
    Judah,  Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,  Dan and
    Naphtali, Gad and Asher.  All the souls who came
    out of Jacob's body were seventy souls, and Joseph
    was in Egypt already.  Joseph died, as did all his
    brothers, and all that generation.  The children of
    Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and
    multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the
    land was filled with them.
     Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who
    didn't know Joseph.  He said to his people,
    'Behold,* the people of the children of Israel are more
    and mightier than we.  Come, let's deal wisely
    with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that
    when any war breaks out, they also join themselves
    to our enemies and fight against us, and escape out
    of the land.'  Therefore they set taskmasters over
    them to afflict them with their burdens. They built
    storage cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.
     But the more they afflicted them, the more they
    multiplied and the more they spread out. They
    started to dread the children of Israel.  The
    Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel
    serve,  and they made their lives bitter with hard
    service in mortar and in brick, and in all kinds of
    service in the field, all their service, in which they
    ruthlessly made them serve.
     The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives,
    of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah,
    and the name of the other Puah,  and he said,
    'When you perform the duty of a midwife to the
    Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool,
    if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a
    daughter, then she shall live.'  But the midwives
    feared God, and didn't do what the king of Egypt
    commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive.
     The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and
    said to them, 'Why have you done this thing and
    saved the boys alive?'
     The midwives said to Pharaoh, 'Because the
    Hebrew women aren't like the Egyptian women; for
    they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife
    comes to them.'
     God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.  Because
    the midwives feared God, he gave them families.
     Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, 'You
    shall cast every son who is born into the river, and
    every daughter you shall save alive.'
    
     A man of the house of Levi went and took a
    daughter of Levi as his wife. The woman conceived
    and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine
    child, she hid him three months.  When she could
    no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for
    him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put
    the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river's
    bank.  His sister stood far off, to see what would
    be done to him.  Pharaoh's daughter came down
    to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by
    the riverside. She saw the basket among the reeds,
    and sent her servant to get it.  She opened it, and
    saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. She had
    compassion on him, and said, 'This is one of the
    Hebrews' children.'
     Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter,
    'Should I go and call a nurse for you from the
    Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for
    you?'
     Pharaoh's daughter said to her, 'Go.'
    The young woman went and called the child's
    mother.  Pharaoh's daughter said to her, 'Take this
    child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you
    your wages.'
    The woman took the child, and nursed it.  The
    child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's
    daughter, and he became her son. She named him
    Moses,* and said, 'Because I drew him out of the
    water.'
     In those days, when Moses had grown up, he
    went out to his brothers and saw their burdens.
    He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his
    brothers.  He looked this way and that way, and
    when he saw that there was no one, he killed the
    Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
     He went out the second day, and behold, two
    men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other.
    He said to him who did the wrong, 'Why do you
    strike your fellow?'
     He said, 'Who made you a prince and a judge
    over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the
    Egyptian?'
    Moses was afraid, and said, 'Surely this thing is
    known.'  Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he
    sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face
    of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he
    sat down by a well.
     Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters.
    They came and drew water, and filled the troughs
    to water their father's flock.  The shepherds came
    and drove them away; but Moses stood up and
    helped them, and watered their flock.  When they
    came to Reuel, their father, he said, 'How is it that
    you have returned so early today?'
     They said, 'An Egyptian delivered us out of the
    hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water
    for us, and watered the flock.'
     He said to his daughters, 'Where is he? Why is
    it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may
    eat bread.'
     Moses was content to dwell with the man. He
    gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter.  She bore a

      
    son, and he named him Gershom, for he said, 'I
    have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land.'
     In the course of those many days, the king of
    Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because
    of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came
    up to God because of the bondage.  God heard
    their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
    with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.  God
    saw the children of Israel, and God understood.
    
     Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro,
    his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led
    the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came
    to God's mountain, to Horeb.  Yahweh's* angel
    appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle
    of a bush. He looked, and behold, the bush burned
    with fire, and the bush was not consumed.  Moses
    said, 'I will go now, and see this great sight, why the
    bush is not burned.'
    When Yahweh saw that he came over to see, God
    called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said,
    'Moses! Moses!'
    He said, 'Here I am.'
     He said, 'Don't come close. Take off your
    sandals, for the place you are standing on is holy
    ground.'  Moreover he said, 'I am the God of your
    father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
    the God of Jacob.'
    Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look
    at God.
    Yahweh said, 'I have surely seen the affliction of
    my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their
    cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their
    sorrows.  I have come down to deliver them out
    of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up
    out of that land to a good and large land, to a land
    flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the
    Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite,
    the Hivite, and the Jebusite.  Now, behold, the cry
    of the children of Israel has come to me. MoreoverI
    have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians
    oppress them.  Come now therefore, and I will
    send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring my people,
    the children of Israel, out of Egypt.'
     Moses said to God, 'Who am I, that I should go
    to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of
    Israel out of Egypt?'
     He said, 'Certainly I will be with you. This will
    be the token to you, that I have sent you: when
    you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall
    serve God on this mountain.'
     Moses said to God, 'Behold, when I come to the
    children of Israel, and tell them, 'The God of your
    fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What
    is his name?' what should I tell them?'
     God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM,' and he
    said, 'You shall tell the children of Israel this: 'I AM
    has sent me to you.' ' God said more over to Moses,
    'You shall tell the children of Israel this, 'Yahweh,
    the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the
    God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me
    to you.' This is my name forever, and this is my
    memorial to all generations.  Go and gather the
    elders of Israel together, and tell them, 'Yahweh,
    the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of
    Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, 'I
    have surely visited you, and seen that which is done
    to you in Egypt.  I have said, I will bring you
    up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the
    Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite,
    the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with
    milk and honey.' '  They will listen to your voice.
    You shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to the
    king of Egypt, and you shall tell him, 'Yahweh, the
    God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please
    let us go three days' journey into the wilderness,
    that we may sacrifice to Yahweh, our God.'  I know
    that the king of Egypt won't give you permission to
    go, no, not by a mighty hand.  I will reach out my
    hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I
    will do among them, and after that he will let you
    go.  I will give this people favor in the sight of
    the Egyptians, and it will happen that when you
    go, you shall not go empty-handed.  But every
    woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who
    visits her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and
    clothing. You shall put them on your sons, and on
    your daughters. You shall plunder the Egyptians.'
    
     Moses answered, 'But, behold, they will not
    believe me, nor listen to my voice; for they will say,
    'Yahweh has not appeared to you.' '
     Yahweh said to him, 'What is that in your
    hand?'
    He said, 'A rod.'
     He said, 'Throw it on the ground.'
    He threw it on the ground, and it became a snake;
    and Moses ran away from it.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Stretch out your hand,
    and take it by the tail.'
    He stretched out his hand, and took hold of it, and
    it became a rod in his hand.
     'This is so that they may believe that Yahweh,
    the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the
    God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to
    you.'  Yahweh said furthermore to him, 'Now put
    your hand inside your cloak.'
    He put his hand inside his cloak, and when he
    took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white
    as snow.
    He said, 'Put your hand inside your cloak again.'
    He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when
    he took it out of his cloak, behold, it had turned
    again as his other flesh.
     'It will happen, if they will not believe you or
    listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will
    believe the voice of the latter sign.  It will happen,
    if they will not believe even these two signs or listen
    to your voice, that you shall take of the water of the
    river, and pour it on the dry land. The water which
    you take out of the river will become blood on the
    dry land.'

      
     Moses said to Yahweh, 'O Lord,* I am not
    eloquent, neither before now, nor since you have
    spoken to your servant; forI am slow of speech, and
    of a slow tongue.'
    Yahweh said to him, 'Who made man's mouth?
    Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind?
    Isn't it I, Yahweh?  Now therefore go, and I will
    be with your mouth, and teach you what you shall
    speak.'
     Moses said, 'Oh, Lord, please send someone
    else.'
     Yahweh's anger burned against Moses, and he
    said, 'What about Aaron, your brother, the Levite?
    I know that he can speak well. Also, behold, he
    is coming out to meet you. When he sees you, he
    will be glad in his heart.  You shall speak to him,
    and put the words in his mouth. I will be with
    your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you
    what you shall do.  He will be your spokesman to
    the people. It will happen that he will be to you a
    mouth, and you will be to him as God.  You shall
    take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do
    the signs.'
     Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law,
    and said to him, 'Please let me go and return
    to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether
    they are still alive.'
    Jethro said to Moses, 'Go in peace.'
     Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, 'Go, return
    into Egypt; for all the men who sought your life are
    dead.'
     Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them
    on a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt.
    Moses took God's rod in his hand.  Yahweh said
    to Moses, 'When you go back into Egypt, see that
    you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have
    put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and he
    will not let the people go.  You shall tell Pharaoh,
    'Yahweh says, Israel is my son, my firstborn,  and I
    have said to you, 'Let my son go, that he may serve
    me;' and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I
    will kill your firstborn son.' '
     On the way at a lodging place, Yahweh met
    Moses and wanted to kill him.  Then Zipporah
    took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and
    cast it at his feet; and she said, 'Surely you are a
    bridegroom of blood to me.'
     So he let him alone. Then she said, 'You are a
    bridegroom of blood,' because of the circumcision.
     Yahweh said to Aaron, 'Go into the wilderness
    to meet Moses.'
    He went, and met him on God's mountain, and
    kissed him.  Moses told Aaron all Yahweh's words
    with which he had sent him, and all the signs with
    which he had instructed him.  Moses and Aaron
    went and gathered together all the elders of the
    children of Israel.  Aaron spoke all the words
    which Yahweh had spoken to Moses, and did the
    signs in the sight of the people.  The people
    believed, and when they heard that Yahweh had
    visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen
    their affliction, then they bowed their heads and
    worshiped.
    
     Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to
    Pharaoh, 'This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel,
    says, 'Let my people go, that they may hold a feast
    to me in the wilderness.' '
     Pharaoh said, 'Who is Yahweh, that I should
    listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don't know
    Yahweh, and moreover I will not let Israel go.'
     They said, 'The God of the Hebrews has met
    with us. Please let us go three days' journey into the
    wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh, our God, lest he
    fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword.'
     The king of Egypt said to them, 'Why do you,
    Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work?
    Get back to your burdens!'  Pharaoh said, 'Behold,
    the people of the land are now many, and you make
    them rest from their burdens.'  The same day
    Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people
    and their officers,saying,  'You shall no longer give
    the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them
    go and gather straw for themselves.  You shall
    require from them the number of the bricks which
    they made before. You shall not diminish anything
    of it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, saying,
    'Let's go and sacrifice to our God.'  Let heavier work
    be laid on the men, that they may labor in it. Don't
    let them pay any attention to lying words.'
     The taskmasters of the people went out with
    their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying,
    'This is what Pharaoh says: 'I will not give you
    straw.  Go yourselves, get straw where you can
    find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.' '
    So the people were scattered abroad
    throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble
    for straw.  The taskmasters were urgent saying,
    'Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was
    straw!'  The officers of the children of Israel,
    whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them,
    were beaten, and were asked, 'Why haven't you
    fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in
    making brick as before?'
     Then the officers of the children of Israel came
    and cried to Pharaoh, saying, 'Why do you deal this
    way with your servants? No straw is given to your
    servants, and they tell us, 'Make brick!' and behold,
    your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your
    own people.'
     But Pharaoh said, 'You are idle! You are
    idle! Therefore you say, 'Let's go and sacrifice to
    Yahweh.'  Go therefore now, and work; for no
    straw shall be given to you; yet you shall deliver the
    same number of bricks!'
     The officers of the children of Israel saw that
    they were in trouble when it was said, 'You shall not
    diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!'
     They met Moses and Aaron, who stood along
    the way, as they came out from Pharaoh.  They
    said to them, 'May Yahweh look at you and judge,
    because you have made us a stench to be abhorred
    in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his
    servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us!'
     Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, 'Lord,
    why have you brought trouble on this people? Why
    is it that you have sent me?  For since I came
      
    to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought
    trouble on this people. You have not rescued your
    people at all!'
    
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Now you shall see what
    I will do to Pharaoh, for by a strong hand he shall let
    them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them
    out of his land.'
     God spoke to Moses, and said to him, 'I am
    Yahweh.  I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
    Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Yahweh I
    was not known to them.  I have also established
    my covenant with them, to give them the land of
    Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they lived
    as aliens.  Moreover I have heard the groaning
    of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep
    in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant.
     Therefore tell the children of Israel, 'I am Yahweh, and I will bring you out from under the
    burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out
    of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an
    outstretched arm, and with great judgments.  I
    will take you to myself for a people. I will be your
    God; and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God,
    who brings you out from under the burdens of the
    Egyptians.  I will bring you into the land which I
    swore to give to Abraham,to Isaac, and to Jacob; and
    I will give it to you for a heritage: I am Yahweh.' '
    Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they
    didn't listen to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for
    cruel bondage.
    Yahweh spoke to Moses,saying,  'Go in,speak
    to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of
    Israel go out of his land.'
     Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, 'Behold,
    the children of Israel haven't listened to me. How
    then shall Pharaoh listen to me, when I have uncircumcised lips?'  Yahweh spoke to Moses and to
    Aaron, and gave them a command to the children
    of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the
    children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
     These are the heads of their fathers' houses.
    The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch,
    and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families
    of Reuben.  The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and
    Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul
    the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families
    of Simeon.  These are the names of the sons of
    Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and
    Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of
    Levi were one hundred thirty-seven years.  The
    sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to
    their families.  The sons of Kohath: Amram, and
    Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the
    life of Kohath were one hundred thirty-three years.
     The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These
    are the families of the Levites according to their
    generations.  Amram took Jochebed his father's
    sister to himself as wife; and she bore him Aaron
    and Moses. The years of the life of Amram were
    one hundred thirty-seven years.  The sons of
    Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.  The sons of
    Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.  Aaron took
    Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of
    Nahshon, as his wife; and she bore him Nadab and
    Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.  The sons of Korah:
    Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families
    of the Korahites.  Eleazar Aaron's son took one of
    the daughters of Putiel as his wife; and she bore him
    Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' houses
    of the Levites according to their families.  These
    are that Aaron and Moses to whom Yahweh said,
    'Bring out the children of Israel from the land of
    Egypt according to their armies.'  These are those
    who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt,to bring out the
    children of Israel from Egypt. These are that Moses
    and Aaron.
     On the day when Yahweh spoke to Moses in
    the land of Egypt,  Yahweh said to Moses, 'I am
    Yahweh. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I tell
    you.'
     Moses said before Yahweh, 'Behold, I am of
    uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh listen to
    me?'
    
    Yahweh said to Moses, 'Behold, I have made you
    as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron your brother shall be
    your prophet.  You shall speak all that I command
    you; and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh,
    that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
     I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my
    signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.  But
    Pharaoh will not listen to you, so I will lay my hand
    on Egypt, and bring out my armies, my people the
    children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great
    judgments.  The Egyptians shall know that I am
    Yahweh when I stretch out my hand on Egypt, and
    bring the children of Israel out from among them.'
    Moses andAaron did so. As Yahweh commanded
    them, so they did.  Moses was eighty years old, and
    Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to
    Pharaoh.
     Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
     'When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Perform a
    miracle!' then you shall tell Aaron, 'Take your rod,
    and cast it down before Pharaoh, and it will become
    a serpent.' '
     Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and
    they did so, as Yahweh had commanded. Aaron
    cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his
    servants, and it became a serpent.  Then Pharaoh
    also called for the wise men and the sorcerers. They
    also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same thing
    with their enchantments.  For they each cast
    down their rods, and they became serpents; but
    Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.  Pharaoh's
    heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them,
    as Yahweh had spoken.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Pharaoh's heart is
    stubborn. He refuses to let the people go.  Go to
    Pharaoh in the morning. Behold, he is going out
    to the water. You shall stand by the river's bank to
    meet him. You shall take the rod which was turned
    to a serpent in your hand.  You shall tell him,
    'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to
    you, saying, 'Let my people go, that they may serve
      
    me in the wilderness. Behold, until now you haven't
    listened.'  Yahweh says, 'In this you shall know
    that I am Yahweh. Behold: I will strike with the
    rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in
    the river, and they shall be turned to blood.  The
    fish that are in the river will die and the river will
    become foul. The Egyptians will loathe to drink
    water from the river.' ' '  Yahweh said to Moses,
    'Tell Aaron, 'Take your rod, and stretch out your
    hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers,
    over their streams, and over their pools, and over all
    their ponds of water, that they may become blood.
    There will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt,
    both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.' '
     Moses and Aaron did so, as Yahweh commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and struck
    the waters that were in the river, in the sight of
    Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the
    waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
     The fish that were in the river died. The river
    became foul. The Egyptians couldn't drink water
    from the river. The blood was throughout all the
    land of Egypt.  The magicians of Egypt did the
    same thing with their enchantments. So Pharaoh's
    heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them,
    as Yahweh had spoken.  Pharaoh turned and went
    into his house, and he didn't even take this to heart.
     All the Egyptians dug around the river for water
    to drink; for they couldn't drink the river water.
    Seven days were fulfilled, after Yahweh had struck
    the river.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, 'Go in to Pharaoh, and
    tell him, 'This is what Yahweh says, 'Let my people
    go, that they may serve me.  If you refuse to let
    them go, behold, I will plague all your borders with
    frogs.  The river will swarm with frogs, which will
    go up and come into your house, and into your
    bedroom, and on your bed, and into the house of
    your servants, and on your people, and into your
    ovens, and into your kneading troughs.  The frogs
    shall come up both on you, and on your people, and
    on all your servants.' ' '  Yahweh said to Moses,
    'Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your rod
    over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools,
    and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.' '
     Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of
    Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land
    of Egypt.  The magicians did the same thing with
    their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the
    land of Egypt.
     Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and
    said, 'Entreat Yahweh, that he take away the frogs
    from me and from my people; and I will let the
    people go, that they may sacrifice to Yahweh.'
     Moses said to Pharaoh, 'I give you the honor of
    setting the time that I should pray for you, and for
    your servants, and for your people, that the frogs be
    destroyed from you and your houses, and remain in
    the river only.'
     Pharaoh said, 'Tomorrow.'
    Moses said, 'Let it be according to your word,that
    you may know that there is no one like Yahweh our
    God.  The frogs shall depart from you, and from
    your houses, and from your servants, and from your
    people. They shall remain in the river only.'
     Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and
    Moses cried to Yahweh concerning the frogs which
    he had brought on Pharaoh.  Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died out of
    the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.
     They gathered them together in heaps, and the
    land stank.  But when Pharaoh saw that there was
    a respite, he hardened his heart, and didn't listen to
    them, as Yahweh had spoken.
    Yahweh said to Moses, 'Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out
    your rod, and strike the dust of the earth, that it
    may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.' '
     They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand
    with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and
    there were lice on man, and on animal; all the
    dust of the earth became lice throughout all the
    land of Egypt.  The magicians tried with their
    enchantments to produce lice, but they couldn't.
    There were lice on man, and on animal.  Then the
    magicians said to Pharaoh, 'This is God's finger;'
    but Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't
    listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Rise up early in the
    morning, and stand before Pharaoh; behold, he
    comes out to the water; and tell him, 'This is what
    Yahweh says, 'Let my people go, that they may
    serve me.  Else, if you will not let my people go,
    behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on
    your servants, and on your people, and into your
    houses. The houses of the Egyptians shall be full
    of swarms of flies, and also the ground they are on.
     I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen,
    in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies
    shall be there, to the end you may know that I
    am Yahweh on the earth.  I will put a division
    between my people and your people. This sign shall
    happen by tomorrow.' ' '  Yahweh did so; and
    there came grievous swarms of flies into the house
    of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses. In all the
    land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of
    the swarms of flies.
     Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and
    said, 'Go, sacrifice to your God in the land!'
    Moses said, 'It isn't appropriate to do so; for we
    shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to
    Yahweh our God. Behold, if we sacrifice the abomination
    of the Egyptians before their eyes, won't they
    stone us?  We will go three days' journey into the
    wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh our God, as he
    shall command us.'
     Pharaoh said, 'I will let you go, that you may
    sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the wilderness, only
    you shall not go very far away. Pray for me.'
     Moses said, 'Behold, I am going out from you.
    I will pray to Yahweh that the swarms of flies may
    depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from
    his people, tomorrow; only don't let Pharaoh deal
    deceitfully any more in not letting the people go
    to sacrifice to Yahweh.'  Moses went out from
    Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.  Yahweh did
    according to the word of Moses, and he removed
      
    the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants,
    and from his people. There remained not one.
     Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he
    didn't let the people go.
    
     Then Yahweh said to Moses, 'Go in to Pharaoh,
    and tell him, 'This is what Yahweh, the God of the
    Hebrews, says: 'Let my people go, that they may
    serve me.  For if you refuse to let them go, and
    hold them still,  behold, Yahweh's hand is on your
    livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on
    the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on
    the flocks with a very grievous pestilence. Yahweh
    will make a distinction between the livestock of
    Israel and the livestock of Egypt; and nothing shall
    die of all that belongs to the children of Israel.' ' '
     Yahweh appointed a set time, saying, 'Tomorrow
    Yahweh shall do this thing in the land.'  Yahweh
    did that thing on the next day; and all the livestock
    of Egypt died, but of the livestock of the children of
    Israel, not one died.  Pharaoh sent, and, behold,
    there was not so much as one of the livestock of
    the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was
    stubborn, and he didn't let the people go.
     Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, 'Take
    handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses
    sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.
     It shall become small dust over all the land of
    Egypt, and shall be boils and blisters breaking out
    on man and on animal, throughout all the land of
    Egypt.'
     They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh;
    and Moses sprinkled it up toward the
    sky; and it became boils and blisters breaking out
    on man and on animal.  The magicians couldn't
    stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils
    were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians.
     Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he
    didn't listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken to
    Moses.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Rise up early in the
    morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him,
    'This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews,
    says: 'Let my people go, that they may serve me.
     For this time I will send all my plagues against
    your heart, against your officials, and against your
    people; that you may know that there is no one
    like me in all the earth.  For now I would have
    stretched out my hand, and struck you and your
    people with pestilence, and you would have been
    cut off from the earth;  but indeed for this cause
    I have made you stand: to show you my power,
    and that my name may be declared throughout all
    the earth,  because you still exalt yourself against
    my people, that you won't let them go.  Behold,
    tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a
    very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt
    since the day it was founded even until now. Now
    therefore command that all of your livestock and all
    that you have in the field be brought into shelter.
    The hail will come down on every man and animal
    that is found in the field, and isn't brought home,
    and they will die.' ' '
     Those who feared Yahweh's word among the
    servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their
    livestock flee into the houses.  Whoever didn't
    respect Yahweh's word left his servants and his
    livestock in the field.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Stretch out your hand
    toward the sky, that there may be hail in all the land
    of Egypt, on man, and on animal, and on every herb
    of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.'
     Moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens,
    and Yahweh sent thunder and hail; and lightning flashed down to the earth.
    Yahweh rained hail
    on the land of Egypt.  So there was very severe
    hail, and lightning mixed with the hail, such as had
    not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a
    nation.  The hail struck throughout all the land of
    Egypt all that was in the field, both man and animal;
    and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke
    every tree of the field. Only in the land of Goshen,
    where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.
     Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron,
    and said to them, 'I have sinned this time. Yahweh
    is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. Pray
    to Yahweh; for there has been enough of mighty
    thunderings and hail. I will let you go, and you shall
    stay no longer.'
     Moses said to him, 'As soon as I have gone out
    of the city, I will spread out my hands to Yahweh.
    The thunders shall cease, and there will not be any
    more hail; that you may know that the earth is
    Yahweh's.  But as for you and your servants, I
    know that you don't yet fear Yahweh God.'
     The flax and the barley were struck, for the
    barley had ripened and the flax was blooming.
     But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for
    they had not grown up. Moses went out of the city
    from Pharaoh, and spread out his hands to Yahweh;
    and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was
    not poured on the earth.  When Pharaoh saw that
    the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased,
    he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and
    his servants.  The heart of Pharaoh was hardened,
    and he didn't let the children of Israel go, just as
    Yahweh had spoken through Moses.
    
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Go in to Pharaoh, for
    I have hardened his heart and the heart of his
    servants, that I may show these my signs among
    them;  and that you may tell in the hearing of your
    son, and of your son's son, what things I have done
    to Egypt, and my signs which I have done among
    them; that you may know that I am Yahweh.'
    Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to
    him, 'This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews,
    says: 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself
    before me? Let my people go, that they may serve
    me.  Or else, if you refuse to let my people go,
    behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your
    country,  and they shall cover the surface of the
    earth, so that one won't be able to see the earth.
    They shall eat the residue of that which has escaped,
    which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat
    every tree which grows for you out of the field.
      
     Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all
    your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians,
    as neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers
    have seen, since the day that they were on the
    earth to this day.' ' He turned, and went out from
    Pharaoh.
     Pharaoh's servants said to him, 'How long will
    this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they
    may serve Yahweh, their God. Don't you yet know
    that Egypt is destroyed?'
     Moses and Aaron were brought again to
    Pharaoh, and he said to them, 'Go, serve Yahweh
    your God; but who are those who will go?'
    Moses said, 'We will go with our young and with
    our old. We will go with our sons and with our
    daughters, with our flocks and with our herds; for
    we must hold a feast to Yahweh.'
     He said to them, 'Yahweh be with you if I let
    you go with your little ones! See, evil is clearly
    before your faces.  Not so! Go now you who
    are men, and serve Yahweh; for that is what you
    desire!' Then they were driven out from Pharaoh's
    presence.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Stretch out your hand
    over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may
    come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of
    the land, even all that the hail has left.'  Moses
    stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and
    Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that
    day, and all night; and when it was morning, the
    east wind brought the locusts.  The locusts went
    up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the
    borders of Egypt. They were very grievous. Before
    them there were no such locusts as they, nor will
    there ever be again.  For they covered the surface
    of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened,
    and they ate every herb of the land, and all the
    fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There
    remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the
    field, through all the land of Egypt. Then Pharaoh
    called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, 'I
    have sinned against Yahweh your God, and against
    you.  Now therefore please forgive my sin again,
    and pray to Yahweh your God, that he may also take
    away from me this death.'
     Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to
    Yahweh. Yahweh sent an exceedingly strong west
    wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them
    into the Red Sea.* There remained not one locust
    in all the borders of Egypt.  But Yahweh hardened
    Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't let the children of
    Israel go.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Stretch out your hand
    toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the
    land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.'
     Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and
    there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt
    for three days.  They didn't see one another, and
    nobody rose from his place for three days; but all
    the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
     Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, 'Go, serve
    Yahweh. Only let your flocks and your herds stay
    behind. Let your little ones also go with you.'
     Moses said, 'You must also give into our hand
    sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice
    to Yahweh our God.  Our livestock also shall go
    with us. Not a hoof shall be left behind, for of it we
    must take to serve Yahweh our God; and we don't
    know with what we must serve Yahweh, until we
    come there.'
     But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he
    wouldn't let them go.  Pharaoh said to him, 'Get
    away from me! Be careful to see my face no more;
    for in the day you see my face you shall die!'
     Moses said, 'You have spoken well. I will see
    your face again no more.'
    
    Yahweh said to Moses, 'I will bring yet one more
    plague on Pharaoh, and on Egypt; afterwards he will
    let you go. When he lets you go, he will surely thrust
    you out altogether.  Speak now in the ears of the
    people, and let every man ask of his neighbor, and
    every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and
    jewels of gold.'  Yahweh gave the people favor
    in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man
    Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the
    sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the
    people.
     Moses said, 'This is what Yahweh says: 'About
    midnight I will go out into the middle of Egypt,
     and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall
    die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his
    throne, even to the firstborn of the female servant
    who is behind the mill, and all the firstborn of
    livestock.  There will be a great cry throughout
    all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been,
    nor will be any more.  But against any of the
    children of Israel a dog won't even bark or move
    its tongue, against man or animal, that you may
    know that Yahweh makes a distinction between the
    Egyptians and Israel.  All these servants of yours
    will come down to me, and bow down themselves to
    me, saying, 'Get out, with all the people who follow
    you;' and after that I will go out.' 'He went out from
    Pharaoh in hot anger.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Pharaoh won't listen to
    you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land
    of Egypt.'  Moses and Aaron did all these wonders
    before Pharaoh, but Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's
    heart, and he didn't let the children of Israel go out
    of his land.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land
    of Egypt, saying,  'This month shall be to you the
    beginning of months. It shall be the first month of
    the year to you.  Speak to all the congregation of
    Israel, saying, 'On the tenth day of this month, they
    shall take to them every man a lamb, according to
    their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household;  and if
    the household is too little for a lamb,then he and his

      
    neighbor next to his house shall take one according
    to the number of the souls. You shall make your
    count for the lamb according to what everyone can
    eat.  Your lamb shall be without defect, a male a
    year old. You shall take it from the sheep or from
    the goats.  You shall keep it until the fourteenth
    day of the same month; and the whole assembly of
    the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening.
     They shall take some of the blood, and put it on
    the two door posts and on the lintel, on the houses
    in which they shall eat it.  They shall eat the meat
    in that night, roasted with fire, with unleavened
    bread. They shall eat it with bitter herbs. Don't eat
    it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with
    fire; with its head, its legs and its inner parts. You
    shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but
    that which remains of it until the morning you shall
    burn with fire.  This is how you shall eat it: with
    your belt on your waist, your sandals on your feet,
    and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it
    in haste: it is Yahweh's Passover.  For I will go
    through the land of Egypt in that night, and will
    strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both
    man and animal. I will execute judgments against
    all the gods of Egypt. I am Yahweh.  The blood
    shall be to you for a token on the houses where you
    are. When I see the blood, I will pass over you, and
    no plague will be on you to destroy you when I strike
    the land of Egypt. This day shall be a memorial for
    you. You shall keep it as a feast to Yahweh. You shall
    keep it as a feast throughout your generations by an
    ordinance forever.
     ' 'Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread;
    even the first day you shall put away yeast out of
    your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from
    the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be
    cut off from Israel.  In the first day there shall be
    to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a
    holy convocation; no kind of work shall be done in
    them, except that which every man must eat, only
    that may be done by you.  You shall observe the
    feast of unleavened bread; for in this same day I
    have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt.
    Therefore you shall observe this day throughout
    your generations by an ordinance forever.  In the
    first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at
    evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the
    twenty first day of the month at evening.  There
    shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven
    days, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that
    soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel,
    whether he is a foreigner, or one who is born in the
    land.  You shall eat nothing leavened. In all your
    habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.' '
     Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel,
    and said to them, 'Draw out, and take lambs according to your families, and kill the Passover.  You
    shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood
    that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two
    door posts with the blood that is in the basin. None
    of you shall go out of the door of his house until the
    morning.  For Yahweh will pass through to strike
    the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the
    lintel, and on the two door posts, Yahweh will pass
    over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to
    come in to your houses to strike you.  You shall
    observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to
    your sons forever.  It shall happen when you have
    come to the land which Yahweh will give you, as he
    has promised, that you shall keep this service.  It
    will happen, when your children ask you, 'What do
    you mean by this service?'  that you shall say, 'It is
    the sacrifice of Yahweh's Passover, who passed over
    the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when
    he struck the Egyptians, and spared our houses.' '
    The people bowed their heads and worshiped.
     The children of Israel went and did so; as Yahweh
    had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
     At midnight, Yahweh struck all the firstborn
    in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh
    who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive
    who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of
    livestock. Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all
    his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a
    great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where
    there was not one dead.  He called for Moses
    and Aaron by night, and said, 'Rise up, get out
    from among my people, both you and the children
    of Israel; and go, serve Yahweh, as you have said!
     Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have
    said, and be gone; and bless me also!'
     The Egyptians were urgent with the people,
    to send them out of the land in haste, for they
    said, 'We are all dead men.'  The people took
    their dough before it was leavened, their kneading
    troughs being bound up in their clothes on their
    shoulders.  The children of Israel did according to
    the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians
    jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing.
     Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the
    Egyptians, so that they let them have what they
    asked. They plundered the Egyptians.
     The children of Israel traveled from Rameses
    to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot
    who were men, in addition to children.  A mixed
    multitude went up also with them, with flocks,
    herds, and even very much livestock.  They baked
    unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought
    out of Egypt; for it wasn't leavened, because they
    were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn't wait, and
    they had not prepared any food for themselves.
     Now the time that the children of Israel lived
    in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.  At the
    end of four hundred thirty years, to the day, all of
    Yahweh's armies went out from the land of Egypt.
     It is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for
    bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is
    that night of Yahweh, to be much observed by all
    the children of Israel throughout their generations.
     Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, 'This is the
    ordinance of the Passover. No foreigner shall eat
    of it,  but every man's servant who is bought for
    money, when you have circumcised him, then shall
    he eat of it.  A foreigner and a hired servant shall
    not eat of it.  It must be eaten in one house.
    You shall not carry any of the meat outside of the
    house. Do not break any of its bones.  All the
    congregation of Israel shall keep it.  When a
      
    stranger lives as a foreigner with you, and would
    like to keep the Passover to Yahweh, let all his males
    be circumcised, and then let him come near and
    keep it. He shall be as one who is born in the land;
    but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.  One
    law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the
    stranger who lives as a foreigner among you.'  All
    the children ofIsrael did so. As Yahweh commanded
    Moses and Aaron, so they did.  That same day,
    Yahweh brought the children of Israel out of the
    land of Egypt by their armies.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Sanctify to
    me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb
    among the children of Israel, both of man and of
    animal. It is mine.'
     Moses said to the people, 'Remember this day,
    in which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of
    bondage; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought
    you out from this place. No leavened bread shall
    be eaten.  Today you go out in the month Abib.
     It shall be, when Yahweh brings you into the land
    of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite,
    and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to
    your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk
    and honey, that you shall keep this service in this
    month. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread,
    and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Yahweh.
     Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the
    seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen
    with you. No yeast shall be seen with you, within all
    your borders.  You shall tell your son in that day,
    saying, 'It is because of that which Yahweh did for
    me when I came out of Egypt.'  It shall be for a sign
    to you on your hand, and for a memorial between
    your eyes, that Yahweh's law may be in your mouth;
    for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out
    of Egypt.  You shall therefore keep this ordinance
    in its season from year to year.
     'It shall be, when Yahweh brings you into the
    land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to
    your fathers, and will give it to you,  that you shall
    set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb, and
    every firstborn that comes from an animal which
    you have. The males shall be Yahweh's.  Every
    firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb;
    and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its
    neck; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man
    among your sons.  It shall be, when your son asks
    you in time to come, saying, 'What is this?' that you
    shall tell him, 'By strength of hand Yahweh brought
    us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.
     When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go,
    Yahweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,
    both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of
    livestock. Therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all that
    opens the womb, being males; but all the firstborn
    of my sons I redeem.'  It shall be for a sign on your
    hand, and for symbols between your eyes; for by
    strength of hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt.'
    When Pharaoh had let the people go, God didn't
    lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines,
    although that was near; for God said, 'Lest perhaps
    the people change their minds when they see war,
    and they return to Egypt';  but God led the people
    around by the way of the wilderness by the Red
    Sea; and the children of Israel went up armed out
    of the land of Egypt.  Moses took the bones of
    Joseph with him, for he had made the children of
    Israel swear, saying, 'God will surely visit you, and
    you shall carry up my bones away from here with
    you.'  They took their journey from Succoth, and
    encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
     Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of
    cloud, to lead them on their way, and by night in
    a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might
    go by day and by night:  the pillar of cloud by day,
    and the pillar of fire by night, didn't depart from
    before the people.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to the
    children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp
    before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea,
    before Baal Zephon. You shall encamp opposite it by
    the sea.  Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel,
    'They are entangled in the land. The wilderness has
    shut them in.'  I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and
    he will follow after them; and I will get honor over
    Pharaoh, and over all his armies; and the Egyptians
    shall know that I am Yahweh.' They did so.
     The king of Egypt was told that the people had
    fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants
    was changed toward the people, and they said,
    'What is this we have done, that we have let Israel
    go from serving us?' He prepared his chariot, and
    took his army with him;  and he took six hundred
    chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, with
    captains over all of them.  Yahweh hardened the
    heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the
    children of Israel; for the children of Israel went
    out with a high hand.*  The Egyptians pursued
    them. All the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his
    horsemen, and his army overtook them encamping
    by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon.
    When Pharaoh came near, the children of Israel
    lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were
    marching after them; and they were very afraid.
    The children of Israel cried out to Yahweh.  They
    said to Moses, 'Because there were no graves in
    Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness?
    Why have you treated us this way, to bring us
    out of Egypt?  Isn't this the word that we spoke
    to you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone, that we
    may serve the Egyptians?' For it would have been
    better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in
    the wilderness.'
     Moses said to the people, 'Don't be afraid.
    Stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh, which
    he will work for you today; for you will never
    again see the Egyptians whom you have seen today.
     Yahweh will fight for you, and you shall be still.'
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Why do you cry to
    me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go
    forward.  Lift up your rod, and stretch out your

      
    hand over the sea and divide it. Then the children
    of Israel shall go into the middle of the sea on dry
    ground.  Behold, I myself will harden the hearts
    of the Egyptians, and they will go in after them. I
    will get myself honor over Pharaoh, and over all his
    armies, over his chariots, and over his horsemen.
     The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh when
    I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh, over his
    chariots, and over his horsemen.'  The angel of
    God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and
    went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved
    from before them, and stood behind them.  It
    came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of
    Israel. There was the cloud and the darkness, yet it
    gave light by night. One didn't come near the other
    all night.
     Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and
    Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east
    wind all night, and made the sea dry land, and the
    waters were divided.  The children of Israel went
    into the middle of the sea on the dry ground; and
    the waters were a wall to them on their right hand
    and on their left.  The Egyptians pursued, and
    went in after them into the middle of the sea: all
    of Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
     In the morning watch, Yahweh looked out on
    the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and
    of cloud, and confused the Egyptian army.  He
    took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them
    heavily; so that the Egyptians said, 'Let's flee from
    the face of Israel, for Yahweh fights for them against
    the Egyptians!'
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Stretch out your hand
    over the sea, that the waters may come again on
    the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.'
    Moses stretched out his hand over the
    sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the
    morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against
    it. Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the middle
    of the sea.  The waters returned, and covered
    the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh's
    army that went in after them into the sea. There
    remained not so much as one of them.  But
    the children of Israel walked on dry land in the
    middle of the sea, and the waters were a wall to
    them on their right hand and on their left.  Thus
    Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of
    the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead
    on the seashore.  Israel saw the great work which
    Yahweh did to the Egyptians, and the people feared
    Yahweh; and they believed in Yahweh and in his
    servant Moses.
    
     Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this
    song to Yahweh, and said,
    'I will sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously.
    He has thrown the horse and his rider into the
    sea.
     Yah is my strength and song.
    He has become my salvation.
    This is my God, and I will praise him;
    my father's God, and I will exalt him.
     Yahweh is a man of war.
    Yahweh is his name.
     He has cast Pharaoh's chariots and his army into
    the sea.
    His chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.
     The deeps cover them.
    They went down into the depths like a stone.
     Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power.
    Your right hand, Yahweh, dashes the enemy in
    pieces.
     In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow
    those who rise up against you.
    You send out your wrath. It consumes them as
    stubble.
     With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were
    piled up.
    The floods stood upright as a heap.
    The deeps were congealed in the heart of the
    sea.
     The enemy said, 'I will pursue. I will overtake. I
    will divide the plunder.
    My desire will be satisfied on them.
    I will draw my sword. My hand will destroy
    them.'
     You blew with your wind.
    The sea covered them.
    They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
     Who is like you, Yahweh, among the gods?
    Who is like you, glorious in holiness,
    fearful in praises, doing wonders?
     You stretched out your right hand.
    The earth swallowed them.
     'You, in your loving kindness, have led the people
    that you have redeemed.
    You have guided them in your strength to your
    holy habitation.
     The peoples have heard.
    They tremble.
    Pangs have taken hold of the inhabitants of
    Philistia.
     Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed.
    Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of
    Moab.
    All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted
    away.
     Terror and dread falls on them.
    By the greatness of your arm they are as still as
    a stone,
    until your people pass over, Yahweh,
    until the people you have purchased pass over.
    You will bring them in, and plant them in the
    mountain of your inheritance,
    the place, Yahweh, which you have made for
    yourself to dwell in:
    the sanctuary, Lord, which your hands have
    established.
     Yahweh will reign forever and ever.'
     For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his
    chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and
    Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them;
    but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the
    middle of the sea.  Miriam the prophetess, the
    sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and
      
    all the women went out after her with tambourines
    and with dances.  Miriam answered them,
    'Sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously.
    He has thrown the horse and his rider into the sea.'
     Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea,
    and they went out into the wilderness of Shur;
    and they went three days in the wilderness, and
    found no water.  When they came to Marah,
    they couldn't drink from the waters of Marah, for
    they were bitter. Therefore its name was called
    Marah.*  The people murmured against Moses,
    saying, 'What shall we drink?'  Then he cried to
    Yahweh. Yahweh showed him a tree, and he threw
    it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet.
    There he made a statute and an ordinance for them,
    and there he tested them.  He said, 'If you will
    diligently listen to Yahweh your God's voice, and
    will do that which is right in his eyes, and will pay
    attention to his commandments, and keep all his
    statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which
    I have put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh who
    heals you.'
     They came to Elim, where there were twelve
    springs of water and seventy palm trees. They
    encamped there by the waters.
    
     They took their journey from Elim, and all the
    congregation of the children of Israel came to the
    wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai,
    on the fifteenth day of the second month after their
    departing out of the land of Egypt.  The whole
    congregation of the children of Israel murmured
    against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness;
     and the children of Israel said to them, 'We wish
    that we had died by Yahweh's hand in the land of
    Egypt, when we sat by the meat pots, when we
    ate our fill of bread, for you have brought us out
    into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with
    hunger.'
     Then Yahweh said to Moses, 'Behold, I will rain
    bread from the sky for you, and the people shall go
    out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may
    test them, whether they will walk in my law or not.
     It shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they
    shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall
    be twice as much as they gather daily.'
     Moses and Aaron said to all the children of
    Israel, 'At evening, you shall know that Yahweh
    has brought you out from the land of Egypt.  In
    the morning, you shall see Yahweh's glory; because
    he hears your murmurings against Yahweh. Who
    are we, that you murmur against us?'  Moses
    said, 'Now Yahweh will give you meat to eat in the
    evening, and in the morning bread to satisfy you,
    because Yahweh hears your murmurings which you
    murmur against him. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against Yahweh.'
     Moses said to Aaron, 'Tell all the congregation of
    the children of Israel, 'Come close to Yahweh, for
    he has heard your murmurings.' ' As Aaron spoke
    to the whole congregation of the children of Israel,
    they looked toward the wilderness, and behold,
    Yahweh's glory appeared in the cloud.  Yahweh
    spoke to Moses, saying,  'I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them,
    saying, 'At evening you shall eat meat, and in the
    morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you
    will know that I am Yahweh your God.' '
     In the evening, quail came up and covered
    the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around
    the camp.  When the dew that lay had gone,
    behold, on the surface of the wilderness was a
    small round thing, small as the frost on the ground.
     When the children of Israel saw it, they said to
    one another, 'What is it?' For they didn't know
    what it was. Moses said to them, 'It is the bread
    which Yahweh has given you to eat.  This is the
    thing which Yahweh has commanded: 'Gather of
    it everyone according to his eating; an omer* a
    head, according to the number of your persons, you
    shall take it, every man for those who are in his
    tent.' '  The children of Israel did so, and some
    gathered more,some less. When they measured it
    with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing
    over, and he who gathered little had no lack. They
    each gathered according to his eating.  Moses
    said to them, 'Let no one leave of it until the
    morning.'  Notwithstanding they didn't listen to
    Moses, but some of them left of it until the morning,
    so it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was
    angry with them.  They gathered it morning by
    morning, everyone according to his eating. When
    the sun grew hot, it melted.  On the sixth day,
    they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for
    each one; and all the rulers of the congregation
    came and told Moses.  He said to them, 'This
    is that which Yahweh has spoken, 'Tomorrow is a
    solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh. Bake that
    which you want to bake, and boil that which you
    want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for
    yourselves to be kept until the morning.' '  They
    laid it up until the morning, as Moses ordered, and
    it didn't become foul, and there were no worms
    in it.  Moses said, 'Eat that today, for today is
    a Sabbath to Yahweh. Today you shall not find it
    in the field.  Six days you shall gather it, but on
    the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be
    none.'  On the seventh day, some of the people
    went out to gather, and they found none. Yahweh
    said to Moses, 'How long do you refuse to keep my
    commandments and my laws?  Behold, because
    Yahweh has given you the Sabbath, therefore he
    gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days.
    Everyone stay in his place. Let no one go out of his
    place on the seventh day.'  So the people rested
    on the seventh day.
     The house of Israel called its name 'Manna',
    and it was like coriander seed, white; and its taste
    was like wafers with honey.  Moses said, 'This is
    the thing which Yahweh has commanded, 'Let an
    omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations,
    that they may see the bread with which I fed you in
    the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land

      
    of Egypt.' '  Moses said to Aaron, 'Take a pot, and
    put an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before
    Yahweh, to be kept throughout your generations.'
    As Yahweh commanded Moses,so Aaron laid it up
    before the Testimony, to be kept.  The children of
    Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to
    an inhabited land. They ate the manna until they
    came to the borders of the land of Canaan.  Now
    an omer is one tenth of an ephah.
    
     All the congregation of the children of Israel
    traveled from the wilderness of Sin,starting according to Yahweh's commandment, and encamped in
    Rephidim; but there was no water for the people to
    drink. Therefore the people quarreled with Moses,
    and said, 'Give us water to drink.'
    Moses said to them, 'Why do you quarrel with
    me? Why do you test Yahweh?'
     The people were thirsty for water there; so the
    people murmured against Moses, and said, 'Why
    have you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our
    children, and our livestock with thirst?'
     Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, 'What shall I do
    with these people? They are almost ready to stone
    me.'
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Walk on before the
    people, and take the elders of Israel with you, and
    take the rod in your hand with which you struck
    the Nile, and go.  Behold, I will stand before
    you there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike
    the rock, and water will come out of it, that the
    people may drink.' Moses did so in the sight of the
    elders of Israel.  He called the name of the place
    Massah,* and Meribah, because the children of
    Israel quarreled, and because they tested Yahweh,
    saying, 'Is Yahweh among us, or not?'
     Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in
    Rephidim.  Moses said to Joshua, 'Choose men for
    us, and go out to fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I
    will stand on the top of the hill with God's rod in
    my hand.'  So Joshua did as Moses had told him,
    and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, andHur
    went up to the top of the hill.  When Moses held
    up his hand, Israel prevailed. When he let down his
    hand, Amalek prevailed.  But Moses' hands were
    heavy; so they took a stone, and put it under him,
    and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held up his hands,
    the one on the one side, and the other on the other
    side. His hands were steady until sunset.  Joshua
    defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the
    sword.  Yahweh said to Moses, 'Write this for a
    memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of
    Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the memory of
    Amalek from under the sky.'  Moses built an altar,
    and called its name 'Yahweh our Banner'.  He
    said, 'Yah has sworn: 'Yahweh will have war with
    Amalek from generation to generation.' '
    
    Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in-law,
    heard of all that God had done for Moses
    and for Israel his people, how Yahweh had brought
    Israel out of Egypt.  Jethro, Moses' father-in-law,
    received Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent
    her away,  and her two sons. The name of one
    son was Gershom,* for Moses said, 'I have lived as
    a foreigner in a foreign land'.  The name of the
    other was Eliezer, for he said, 'My father's God was
    my help and delivered me from Pharaoh's sword.'
     Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with Moses'
    sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness
    where he was encamped, at the Mountain of God.
     He said to Moses, 'I, your father-in-law Jethro,
    have come to you with your wife, and her two sons
    with her.'
     Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and
    bowed and kissed him. They asked each other of
    their welfare, and they came into the tent.  Moses
    told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to
    Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all
    the hardships that had come on them on the way,
    and how Yahweh delivered them.  Jethro rejoiced
    for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to
    Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the
    hand of the Egyptians.  Jethro said, 'Blessed be
    Yahweh, who has delivered you out of the hand of
    the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who
    has delivered the people from under the hand of the
    Egyptians.  Now I know that Yahweh is greater
    than all gods because of the way that they treated
    people arrogantly.'  Jethro, Moses' father-in-law,
    took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron
    came with all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with
    Moses' father-in-law before God.
     On the next day, Moses sat to judge the people,
    and the people stood around Moses from the
    morning to the evening.  When Moses' father-in law saw all that he did to the people,
    he said, 'What
    is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you
    sit alone, and all the people stand around you from
    morning to evening?'
     Moses said to his father-in-law, 'Because the
    people come to me to inquire of God.  When they
    have a matter,they come to me, and I judge between
    a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the
    statutes of God, and his laws.'  Moses' father-in-law said to him,
    'The thing that you do is not good.
     You will surely wear away, both you, and this
    people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for
    you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone.
     Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel,
    and God be with you. You represent the people
    before God, and bring the causes to God.  You
    shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall
    show them the way in which they must walk, and
    the work that they must do.  Moreover you shall
    provide out of all the people able men which fear
    God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place

      
    such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of
    hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.  Let
    them judge the people at all times. It shall be that
    every great matter they shall bring to you, but every
    small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it
    be easier for you, and they shall share the load with
    you.  If you will do this thing, and God commands
    you so, then you will be able to endure, and all these
    people also will go to their place in peace.'
     So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in law,
    and did all that he had said.  Moses chose
    able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over
    the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds,
    rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.  They judged
    the people at all times. They brought the hard
    cases to Moses, but every small matter they judged
    themselves.  Moses let his father-in-law depart,
    and he went his way into his own land.
    
     In the third month after the children of Israel
    had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that same
    day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.  When
    they had departed from Rephidim, and had come
    to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the
    wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the
    mountain.  Moses went up to God, and Yahweh
    called to him out of the mountain, saying, 'This is
    what you shall tell the house of Jacob, and tell the
    children of Israel:  'You have seen what I did to
    the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings,
    and brought you to myself.  Now therefore, if you
    will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant,
    then you shall be my own possession from among
    all peoples; for all the earth is mine;  and you shall
    be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.'
    These are the words which you shall speak to the
    children of Israel.'
     Moses came and called for the elders of the
    people, and set before them all these words which
    Yahweh commanded him. All the people answered
    together, and said, 'All that Yahweh has spoken we
    will do.'
    Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh.
    Yahweh said to Moses, 'Behold, I come to
    you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when
    I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.'
    Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Go to the people, and
    sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them
    wash their garments,  and be ready for the third
    day; for on the third day Yahweh will come down
    in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.  You
    shall set bounds to the people all around,saying, 'Be
    careful that you don't go up onto the mountain, or
    touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain
    shall be surely put to death.  No hand shall touch
    him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through;
    whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.' When
    the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the
    mountain.'
     Moses went down from the mountain to the
    people, and sanctified the people; and they washed
    their clothes.  He said to the people, 'Be ready
    by the third day. Don't have sexual relations with
    a woman.'
     On the third day, when it was morning, there
    were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on
    the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud
    trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp
    trembled.  Moses led the people out of the camp
    to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the
    mountain.  All of Mount Sinai smoked, because
    Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its smoke
    ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole
    mountain quaked greatly.  When the sound of the
    trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and
    God answered him by a voice. Yahweh came down
    on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. Yahweh
    called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses
    went up.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Go down, warn the
    people, lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze,
    and many of them perish.  Let the priests also,
    who come near to Yahweh,sanctify themselves, lest
    Yahweh break out on them.'
     Moses said to Yahweh, 'The people can't come
    up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying, 'Set
    bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.' '
     Yahweh said to him, 'Go down! You shall bring
    Aaron up with you, but don't let the priests and the
    people break through to come up to Yahweh, lest he
    break out against them.'
     So Moses went down to the people, and told
    them.
    
     God* spoke all these words, saying,  'I am
    Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land
    of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
     'You shall have no other gods before me.
     'You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor
    any image of anything that is in the heavens above,
    or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water
    under the earth:  you shall not bow yourself down
    to them, nor serve them, for I, Yahweh your God,
    am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
    on the children, on the third and on the fourth
    generation of those who hate me,  and showing
    loving kindness to thousands of those who love me
    and keep my commandments.
     'You shall not misuse the name of Yahweh your
    God, for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who
    misuses his name.
     'Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
     You shall labor six days, and do all your work,
     but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your
    God. You shall not do any work in it, you, nor
    your son, nor your daughter, your male servant, nor
    your female servant, nor your livestock, nor your
    stranger who is within your gates;  for in six days
    Yahweh made heaven and earth,the sea, and all that

      
    is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore
    Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day, and made it holy.
     'Honor your father and your mother, that your
    days may be long in the land which Yahweh your
    God gives you.
     'You shall not murder.
     'You shall not commit adultery.
     'You shall not steal.
     'You shall not give false testimony against your
    neighbor.
     'You shall not covet your neighbor's house.
    You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his
    male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor
    his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.'
     All the people perceived the thunderings, the
    lightnings, the sound of the trumpet, and the
    mountain smoking. When the people saw it, they
    trembled, and stayed at a distance.  They said to
    Moses, 'Speak with us yourself, and we will listen;
    but don't let God speak with us, lest we die.'
     Moses said to the people, 'Don't be afraid, for
    God has come to test you, and that his fear may
    be before you, that you won't sin.'  The people
    stayed at a distance, and Moses came near to the
    thick darkness where God was.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'This is what you shall
    tell the children of Israel: 'You yourselves have seen
    that I have talked with you from heaven. You shall
    most certainly not make gods of silver or gods of
    gold for yourselves to be alongside me.  You shall
    make an altar of earth for me, and shall sacrifice
    on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings,
    your sheep and your cattle. In every place where I
    record my name I will come to you and I will bless
    you.  If you make me an altar of stone, you shall
    not build it of cut stones; for if you lift up your tool
    on it, you have polluted it.  You shall not go up by
    steps to my altar, that your nakedness may not be
    exposed to it.'
    
     'Now these are the ordinances which you shall
    set before them:
     'If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six
    years, and in the seventh he shall go out free without paying anything.  If he comes in by himself, he
    shall go out by himself. If he is married, then his
    wife shall go out with him.  If his master gives him
    a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife
    and her children shall be her master's, and he shall
    go out by himself.  But if the servant shall plainly
    say, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children.
    I will not go out free;'  then his master shall bring
    him to God, and shall bring him to the door or to the
    doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear through
    with an awl, and he shall serve him forever.
     'If a man sells his daughter to be a female
    servant,she shall not go out as the male servants do.
     If she doesn't please her master, who has married
    her to himself,then he shall let her be redeemed. He
    shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people,
    since he has dealt deceitfully with her.  If he
    marries her to his son, he shall deal with her as a
    daughter.  If he takes another wife to himself, he
    shall not diminish her food, her clothing, and her
    marital rights.  If he doesn't do these three things
    for her, she may go free without paying any money.
     'One who strikes a man so that he dies shall
    surely be put to death,  but not if it is unintentional, but God allows it to happen; then I will
    appoint you a place where he shall flee.  If a
    man schemes and comes presumptuously on his
    neighbor to kill him, you shall take him from my
    altar, that he may die.
     'Anyone who attacks his father or his mother
    shall be surely put to death.
     'Anyone who kidnaps someone and sells him,
    or if he is found in his hand, he shall surely be put
    to death.
     'Anyone who curses his father or his mother
    shall surely be put to death.
     'If men quarrel and one strikes the other with
    a stone, or with his fist, and he doesn't die, but is
    confined to bed;  if he rises again and walks around
    with his staff, then he who struck him shall be
    cleared; only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and
    shall provide for his healing until he is thoroughly
    healed.
     'If a man strikes his servant or his maid with
    a rod, and he dies under his hand, the man shall
    surely be punished.  Notwithstanding, if his
    servant gets up after a day or two, he shall not be
    punished, for the servant is his property.
     'If men fight and hurt a pregnant woman so
    that she gives birth prematurely, and yet no harm
    follows, he shall be surely fined as much as the
    woman's husband demands and the judges allow.
     But if any harm follows, then you must take life
    for life,  eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for
    hand, foot for foot,  burning for burning, wound
    for wound, and bruise for bruise.
     'If a man strikes his servant's eye, or his maid's
    eye, and destroys it, he shall let him go free for his
    eye's sake.  If he strikes out his male servant's
    tooth, or his female servant's tooth, he shall let the
    servant go free for his tooth's sake.
     'If a bull gores a man or a woman to death, the
    bull shall surely be stoned, and its meat shall not be
    eaten; but the owner of the bull shall not be held
    responsible.  But if the bull had a habit of goring
    in the past, and this has been testified to its owner,
    and he has not kept it in, but it has killed a man or a
    woman, the bull shall be stoned, and its owner shall
    also be put to death.  If a ransom is imposed on
    him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life
    whatever is imposed.  Whether it has gored a son
    or has gored a daughter, according to this judgment
    it shall be done to him.  If the bull gores a male
    servant or a female servant, thirty shekels* of silver
    shall be given to their master, and the ox shall be
    stoned.
     'If a man opens a pit, or if a man digs a pit and
    doesn't cover it, and a bull or a donkey falls into it,
     the owner of the pit shall make it good. He shall

      
    give money to its owner, and the dead animal shall
    be his.
     'If one man's bull injures another's, so that it
    dies, then they shall sell the live bull, and divide its
    price; and they shall also divide the dead animal.
     Or if it is known that the bull was in the habit of
    goring in the past, and its owner has not kept it in,
    he shall surely pay bull for bull, and the dead animal
    shall be his own.
    
     'If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it or
    sells it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four
    sheep for a sheep.  If the thief is found breaking
    in, and is struck so that he dies, there shall be no
    guilt of bloodshed for him.  If the sun has risen
    on him, he is guilty of bloodshed. He shall make
    restitution. If he has nothing, then he shall be sold
    for his theft.  If the stolen property is found in his
    hand alive, whether it is ox, donkey, or sheep, he
    shall pay double.
     'If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten
    by letting his animal loose, and it grazes in another
    man's field, he shall make restitution from the best
    of his own field, and from the best of his own
    vineyard.
     'If fire breaks out, and catches in thorns so that
    the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the
    field are consumed; he who kindled the fire shall
    surely make restitution.
     'If a man delivers to his neighbor money or stuff
    to keep, and it is stolen out of the man's house,
    if the thief is found, he shall pay double.  If the
    thief isn't found, then the master of the house shall
    come near to God, to find out whether or not he has
    put his hand on his neighbor's goods.  For every
    matter of trespass, whether it is for ox, for donkey,
    for sheep, for clothing, or for any kind of lost thing,
    about which one says, 'This is mine,' the cause of
    both parties shall come before God. He whom God
    condemns shall pay double to his neighbor.
     'If a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey, an
    ox, a sheep, or any animal to keep, and it dies or is
    injured, or driven away, no man seeing it;  the oath
    of Yahweh shall be between them both, he has not
    put his hand on his neighbor's goods; and its owner
    shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.
     But if it is stolen from him, the one who stole
    shall make restitution to its owner.  If it is torn
    in pieces, let him bring it for evidence. He shall not
    make good that which was torn.
     'If a man borrows anything of his neighbor's,
    and it is injured, or dies, its owner not being with
    it, he shall surely make restitution.  If its owner
    is with it, he shall not make it good. If it is a leased
    thing, it came for its lease.
     'If a man entices a virgin who isn't pledged to
    be married, and lies with her, he shall surely pay a
    dowry for her to be his wife.  If her father utterly
    refuses to give her to him, he shall pay money
    according to the dowry of virgins.
     'You shall not allow a sorceress to live.
     'Whoever has sex with an animal shall surely
    be put to death.
     'He who sacrifices to any god, except to Yahweh only,
    shall be utterly destroyed.
     'You shall not wrong an alien or oppress him,
    for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.
     'You shall not take advantage of any widow or
    fatherless child.  If you take advantage of them at
    all, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their
    cry;  and my wrath will grow hot, and I will kill you
    with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and
    your children fatherless.
     'If you lend money to any of my people with
    you who is poor, you shall not be to him as a
    creditor. You shall not charge him interest.  If
    you take your neighbor's garment as collateral, you
    shall restore it to him before the sun goes down,
     for that is his only covering, it is his garment for
    his skin. What would he sleep in? It will happen,
    when he cries to me, that I will hear, for I am
    gracious.
     'You shall not blaspheme God, nor curse a ruler
    of your people.
     'You shall not delay to offer from your harvest
    and from the outflow of your presses.
    'You shall give the firstborn of your sons to me.
     You shall do likewise with your cattle and with
    your sheep. It shall be with its mother seven days,
    then on the eighth day you shall give it to me.
     'You shall be holy men to me, therefore you
    shall not eat any meat that is torn by animals in the
    field. You shall cast it to the dogs.
    
     'You shall not spread a false report. Don't
    join your hand with the wicked to be a malicious
    witness.
     'You shall not follow a crowd to do evil. You
    shall not testify in court to side with a multitude to
    pervert justice.  You shall not favor a poor man in
    his cause.
     'If you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey
    going astray, you shall surely bring it back to him
    again.  If you see the donkey of him who hates you
    fallen down under his burden, don't leave him. You
    shall surely help him with it.
     'You shall not deny justice to your poor people
    in their lawsuits.
     'Keep far from a false charge, and don't kill the
    innocent and righteous; for I will not justify the
    wicked.
     'You shall take no bribe, for a bribe blinds
    those who have sight and perverts the words of the
    righteous.
     'You shall not oppress an alien, for you know
    the heart of an alien, since you were aliens in the
    land of Egypt.
     'For six years you shall sow your land, and shall
    gather in its increase,  but the seventh year you
    shall let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of your
    people may eat; and what they leave the animal of
    the field shall eat. In the same way, you shall deal
    with your vineyard and with your olive grove.
     'Six days you shall do your work, and on the
    seventh day you shall rest, that your ox and your
      
    donkey may have rest, and the son of your servant,
    and the alien may be refreshed.
     'Be careful to do all things that I have said to
    you; and don't invoke the name of other gods or
    even let them be heard out of your mouth.
     'You shall observe a feast to me three times a
    year.  You shall observe the feast of unleavened
    bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread,
    as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the
    month Abib (for in it you came out of Egypt), and no
    one shall appear before me empty.  And the feast
    of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you
    sow in the field; and the feast of in gathering, at the
    end of the year, when you gather in your labors out
    of the field. Three times in the year all your males
    shall appear before the Lord Yahweh.
     'You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice
    with leavened bread. The fat of my feast shall not
    remain all night until the morning.
     You shall bring the first of the first fruits of
    your ground into the house of Yahweh your God.
    'You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's
    milk.
     'Behold, I send an angel before you,to keep you
    by the way, and to bring you into the place which I
    have prepared.  Pay attention to him, and listen to
    his voice. Don't provoke him, for he will not pardon
    your disobedience, for my name is in him.  But
    if you indeed listen to his voice, and do all that I
    speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies,
    and an adversary to your adversaries.  For my
    angel shall go before you, and bring you in to the
    Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite,
    the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I will cut them
    off.  You shall not bow down to their gods, nor
    serve them, nor follow their practices, but you shall
    utterly overthrow them and demolish their pillars.
    You shall serve Yahweh your God, and he will bless
    your bread and your water, and I will take sickness
    away from among you.  No one will miscarry or
    be barren in your land. I will fulfill the number of
    your days.  I will send my terror before you, and
    will confuse all the people to whom you come, and I
    will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.
     I will send the hornet before you, which will drive
    out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from
    before you.  I will not drive them out from before
    you in one year, lest the land become desolate,
    and the animals of the field multiply against you.
     Little by little I will drive them out from before
    you, until you have increased and inherit the land.
     I will set your border from the Red Sea even to the
    sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the
    River; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land
    into your hand, and you shall drive them out before
    you.  You shall make no covenant with them, nor
    with their gods. They shall not dwell in your land,
    lest they make you sin against me, for if you serve
    their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.'
    
    He said to Moses, 'Come up to Yahweh, you, and
    Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders
    ofIsrael; and worship from a distance. Moses alone
    shall come near to Yahweh, but they shall not come
    near. The people shall not go up with him.'
     Moses came and told the people all Yahweh's
    words, and all the ordinances; and all the people
    answered with one voice, and said, 'All the words
    which Yahweh has spoken will we do.'
     Moses wrote all Yahweh's words, then rose up
    early in the morning and built an altar at the base
    of the mountain, with twelve pillars for the twelve
    tribes of Israel. He sent young men of the children
    of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed
    peace offerings of cattle to Yahweh.  Moses took
    half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the
    blood he sprinkled on the altar.  He took the book
    of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the
    people, and they said, 'We will do all that Yahweh
    has said, and be obedient.'
     Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the
    people, and said, 'Look, this is the blood of the
    covenant, which Yahweh has made with you concerning all these words.'
     Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy
    of the elders of Israel went up.  They saw the God
    of Israel. Under his feet was like a paved work of
    sapphire* stone, like the skies for clearness.  He
    didn't lay his hand on the nobles of the children of
    Israel. They saw God, and ate and drank.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Come up to me on the
    mountain, and stay here, and I will give you the
    stone tablets with the law and the commands that I
    have written, that you may teach them.'
     Moses rose up with Joshua, his servant, and
    Moses went up onto God's Mountain.  He said to
    the elders, 'Wait here for us, until we come again to
    you. Behold, Aaron and Hur are with you. Whoever
    is involved in a dispute can go to them.'
     Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud
    covered the mountain.  Yahweh's glory settled on
    Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. The
    seventh day he called to Moses out of the middle
    of the cloud.  The appearance of Yahweh's glory
    was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain
    in the eyes of the children ofIsrael. Moses entered
    into the middle of the cloud, and went up on the
    mountain; and Moses was on the mountain forty
    days and forty nights.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to the
    children of Israel, that they take an offering for me.
    From everyone whose heart makes him willing you
    shall take my offering.  This is the offering which
    you shall take from them: gold, silver, bronze,
     blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair,  rams'
    skins dyed red, sea cow hides,* acacia wood,  oil
    for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the
    sweet incense,  onyx stones, and stones to be set
    for the ephod and for the breastplate.  Let them
    make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.
    According to all that I show you, the pattern of the

      
    tabernacle, and the pattern of all of its furniture,
    even so you shall make it.
     'They shall make an ark of acacia wood. Its
    length shall be two and a half cubits, its width a
    cubit and a half, and a cubit and a half its height.
     You shall overlay it with pure gold. You shall
    overlay it inside and outside, and you shall make a
    gold molding around it.  You shall cast four rings
    of gold for it, and put them in its four feet. Two
    rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings
    on the other side of it.  You shall make poles of
    acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.  You
    shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of
    the ark to carry the ark.  The poles shall be in
    the rings of the ark. They shall not be taken from
    it.  You shall put the covenant which I shall give
    you into the ark.  You shall make a mercy seat of
    pure gold. Two and a half cubits shall be its length,
    and a cubit and a half its width.  You shall make
    two cherubim of hammered gold. You shall make
    them at the two ends of the mercy seat.  Make one
    cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other
    end. You shall make the cherubim on its two ends
    of one piece with the mercy seat.  The cherubim
    shall spread out their wings upward, covering the
    mercy seat with their wings, with their faces toward
    one another. The faces of the cherubim shall be
    toward the mercy seat.  You shall put the mercy
    seat on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put
    the covenant that I will give you. There I will meet
    with you, and I will tell you from above the mercy
    seat, from between the two cherubim which are on
    the ark of the covenant, all that I command you for
    the children of Israel.
     'You shall make a table of acacia wood. Its
    length shall be two cubits, and its width a cubit, and
    its height one and a half cubits.  You shall overlay
    it with pure gold, and make a gold molding around
    it. You shall make a rim of a hand width around it.
    You shall make a golden molding on its rim around
    it. You shall make four rings of gold for it, and put
    the rings in the four corners that are on its four feet.
     The rings shall be close to the rim, for places for
    the poles to carry the table.  You shall make the
    poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold,
    that the table may be carried with them.  You
    shall make its dishes, its spoons, its ladles, and its
    bowls with which to pour out offerings. You shall
    make them of pure gold.  You shall set bread of
    the presence on the table before me always.
     'You shall make a lamp stand of pure gold. The
    lamp stand shall be made of hammered work. Its
    base, its shaft, its cups, its buds, and its flowers shall
    be of one piece with it. There shall be six branches
    going out of its sides: three branches of the lamp
    stand out of its one side, and three branches of the
    lamp stand out of its other side;  three cups made
    like almond blossoms in one branch, a bud and a
    flower; and three cups made like almond blossoms
    in the other branch, a bud and a flower,so for the six
    branches going out of the lamp stand;  and in the
    lamp stand four cups made like almond blossoms,
    its buds and its flowers;  and a bud under two
    branches of one piece with it, and a bud under two
    branches of one piece with it, and a bud under two
    branches of one piece with it, for the six branches
    going out of the lamp stand.  Their buds and their
    branches shall be of one piece with it, all of it one
    beaten work of pure gold.  You shall make its
    lamps seven, and they shall light its lamps to give
    light to the space in front of it.  Its snuffers and its
    snuff dishes shall be of pure gold.  it shall be made
    of a talent of pure gold, with all these accessories.
     See that you make them after their pattern, which
    has been shown to you on the mountain.
    
     'Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with
    ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and
    purple, and scarlet, with cherubim. You shall make
    them with the work of a skillful workman.  The
    length of each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits,*
    and the width of each curtain four cubits: all the
    curtains shall have one measure.  Five curtains
    shall be coupled together to one another, and the
    other five curtains shall be coupled to one another.
     You shall make loops of blue on the edge of the
    one curtain from the edge in the coupling, and you
    shall do likewise on the edge of the curtain that is
    outermost in the second coupling.  You shall make
    fifty loops in the one curtain, and you shall make
    fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that is in the
    second coupling. The loops shall be opposite one
    another.  You shall make fifty clasps of gold, and
    couple the curtains to one another with the clasps.
    The tabernacle shall be a unit.
     'You shall make curtains of goats' hair for a
    covering over the tabernacle. You shall make eleven
    curtains.  The length of each curtain shall be thirty
    cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits:
    the eleven curtains shall have one measure.  You
    shall couple five curtains by themselves, and six
    curtains by themselves, and shall double over the
    sixth curtain in the forefront of the tent.  You
    shall make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain
    that is outermost in the coupling, and fifty loops
    on the edge of the curtain which is outermost in
    the second coupling.  You shall make fifty clasps
    of bronze, and put the clasps into the loops, and
    couple the tent together, that it may be one.  The
    overhanging part that remains of the curtains of the
    tent-the half curtain that remains-shall hang over
    the back of the tabernacle.  The cubit on the one
    side and the cubit on the other side, of that which
    remains in the length of the curtains of the tent,
    shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this
    side and on that side, to cover it.  You shall make
    a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and
    a covering of sea cow hides above.

      
     'You shall make the boards for the tabernacle
    of acacia wood, standing upright.  Ten cubits shall
    be the length of a board, and one and a half cubits
    the width of each board.  There shall be two
    tenons in each board, joined to one another: thus
    you shall make for all the boards of the tabernacle.
     You shall make twenty boards for the tabernacle,
    for the south side southward.  You shall make
    forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two
    sockets under one board for its two tenons, and
    two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
     For the second side of the tabernacle, on the
    north side, twenty boards,  and their forty sockets
    of silver; two sockets under one board, and two
    sockets under another board.  For the far side of
    the tabernacle westward you shall make six boards.
     You shall make two boards for the corners of the
    tabernacle in the far side.  They shall be double
    beneath, and in the same way they shall be whole
    to its top to one ring: thus shall it be for them
    both; they shall be for the two corners.  There
    shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver,
    sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and
    two sockets under another board.
     'You shall make bars of acacia wood: five for
    the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,  and
    five bars for the boards of the other side of the
    tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side
    of the tabernacle, for the far side westward.  The
    middle bar in the middle of the boards shall pass
    through from end to end.  You shall overlay the
    boards with gold, and make their rings of gold for
    places for the bars. You shall overlay the bars with
    gold.  You shall set up the tabernacle according to
    the way that it was shown to you on the mountain.
     'You shall make a veil of blue, and purple, and
    scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cherubim. It
    shall be the work of a skillful workman.  You shall
    hang it on four pillars of acacia overlaid with gold;
    their hooks shall be of gold, on four sockets of silver.
     You shall hang up the veil under the clasps, and
    shall bring the ark of the covenant in there within
    the veil. The veil shall separate the holy place from
    the most holy for you.  You shall put the mercy
    seat on the ark of the covenant in the most holy
    place.  You shall set the table outside the veil, and
    the lamp stand opposite the table on the side of the
    tabernacle toward the south. You shall put the table
    on the north side.
     'You shall make a screen for the door of the
    Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
    twined linen, the work of the embroiderer.  You
    shall make for the screen five pillars of acacia, and
    overlay them with gold. Their hooks shall be of
    gold. You shall cast five sockets of bronze for them.
    
     'You shall make the altar of acacia wood, five
    cubits* long, and five cubits wide. The altar shall be
    square. Its height shall be three cubits.  You shall
    make its horns on its four corners. Its horns shall be
    of one piece with it. You shall overlay it with bronze.
     You shall make its pots to take away its ashes; and
    its shovels, its basins, its meat hooks, and its fire
    pans. You shall make all its vessels of bronze.  You
    shall make a grating for it of network of bronze. On
    the net you shall make four bronze rings in its four
    corners.  You shall put it under the ledge around
    the altar beneath, that the net may reach halfway
    up the altar.  You shall make poles for the altar,
    poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with bronze.
     Its poles shall be put into the rings, and the poles
    shall be on the two sides of the altar when carrying
    it. You shall make it hollow with planks. They shall
    make it as it has been shown you on the mountain.
     'You shall make the court of the tabernacle: for
    the south side southward there shall be hangings
    for the court of fine twined linen one hundred
    cubits long for one side.  Its pillars shall be twenty,
    and their sockets twenty, of bronze. The hooks
    of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver.
     Likewise for the length of the north side, there
    shall be hangings one hundred cubits long, and its
    pillars twenty, and their sockets twenty, of bronze;
    the hooks of the pillars, and their fillets, of silver.
     for the width of the court on the westside shall be
    hangings of fifty cubits; their pillars ten, and their
    sockets ten.  The width of the court on the east
    side eastward shall be fifty cubits.  The hangings
    for the one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits;
    their pillars three, and their sockets three. for the
    other side shall be hangings of fifteen cubits; their
    pillars three, and their sockets three.  for the gate
    of the court shall be a screen of twenty cubits, of
    blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen,
    the work of the embroiderer; their pillars four, and
    their sockets four.  All the pillars of the court
    around shall be filleted with silver; their hooks of
    silver, and their sockets of bronze.  The length of
    the court shall be one hundred cubits, and the width
    fifty throughout, and the height five cubits, of fine
    twined linen, and their sockets of bronze.  All the
    instruments of the tabernacle in all its service, and
    all its pins, and all the pins of the court, shall be of
    bronze.
     'You shall command the children of Israel, that
    they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light,
    to cause a lamp to burn continually.  In the Tent
    of Meeting, outside the veil which is before the
    covenant, Aaron and his sons shall keep it in order
    from evening to morning before Yahweh: it shall be
    a statute forever throughout their generations on
    the behalf of the children of Israel.
    
     'Bring Aaron your brother, and his sons with
    him, near to you from among the children of Israel,
    that he may minister to me in the priest's office:
    Aaron, with Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar,
    Aaron's sons.  You shall make holy garments for
    Aaron your brother, for glory and for beauty.  You
    shall speak to all who are wise-hearted, whom I
    have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they

      
    make Aaron's garments to sanctify him,that he may
    minister to me in the priest's office.  These are
    the garments which they shall make: a breastplate,
    an ephod, a robe, a fitted tunic, a turban, and a
    sash. They shall make holy garments for Aaron your
    brother and his sons, that he may minister to me in
    the priest's office.  They shall use the gold, and the
    blue, and the purple, and the scarlet, and the fine
    linen.
     'They shall make the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the
    skillful workman.  It shall have two shoulder straps
    joined to the two ends of it, that it may be joined
    together.  The skillfully woven band, which is on
    it, shall be like its work and of the same piece; of
    gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.
     You shall take two onyx stones, and engrave on
    them the names of the children of Israel.  Six of
    their names on the one stone, and the names of the
    six that remain on the other stone, in the order of
    their birth. With the work of an engraver in stone,
    like the engravings of a signet, you shall engrave the
    two stones, according to the names of the children
    of Israel. You shall make them to be enclosed in
    settings of gold.  You shall put the two stones on
    the shoulder straps of the ephod, to be stones of
    memorial for the children of Israel. Aaron shall bear
    their names before Yahweh on his two shoulders for
    a memorial. You shall make settings of gold,  and
    two chains of pure gold; you shall make them like
    cords of braided work. You shall put the braided
    chains on the settings.
     'You shall make a breastplate of judgment, the
    work of the skillful workman; like the work of the
    ephod you shall make it; of gold, of blue, and purple,
    and scarlet, and fine twined linen, you shall make
    it.  It shall be square and folded double; a span*
    shall be its length, and a span its width.  You
    shall set in it settings of stones, four rows of stones:
    a row of ruby, topaz, and beryl shall be the first
    row;  and the second row a turquoise, a sapphire,
    and an emerald;  and the third row a jacinth, an
    agate, and an amethyst;  and the fourth row a
    chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper. They shall be
    enclosed in gold in their settings.  The stones
    shall be according to the names of the children of
    Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the
    engravings of a signet, everyone according to his
    name, they shall be for the twelve tribes.  You
    shall make on the breastplate chains like cords, of
    braided work of pure gold.  You shall make on the
    breastplate two rings of gold, and shall put the two
    rings on the two ends of the breastplate. You shall
    put the two braided chains of gold in the two rings
    at the ends of the breastplate. The other two ends
    of the two braided chains you shall put on the two
    settings, and put them on the shoulder straps of the
    ephod in its forepart.  You shall make two rings of
    gold, and you shall put them on the two ends of the
    breastplate, on its edge, which is toward the side of
    the ephod inward.  You shall make two rings of
    gold, and shall put them on the two shoulder straps
    of the ephod underneath, in its forepart, close by
    its coupling, above the skillfully woven band of the
    ephod. They shall bind the breastplate by its rings
    to the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it
    may be on the skillfully woven band of the ephod,
    and that the breastplate may not swing out from
    the ephod.  Aaron shall bear the names of the
    children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment on
    his heart, when he goes in to the holy place, for a
    memorial before Yahweh continually.  You shall
    put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and
    the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart,
    when he goes in before Yahweh. Aaron shall bear
    the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart
    before Yahweh continually.
     'You shall make the robe of the ephod all of
    blue.  It shall have a hole for the head in the
    middle of it. It shall have a binding of woven work
    around its hole, as it were the hole of a coat of mail,
    that it not be torn.  On its hem you shall make
    pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet,
    all around its hem; with bells of gold between and
    around them:  a golden bell and a pomegranate,
    a golden bell and a pomegranate, around the hem
    of the robe.  It shall be on Aaron to minister: and
    its sound shall be heard when he goes in to the holy
    place before Yahweh, and when he comes out, that
    he not die.
     'You shall make a plate of pure gold, and
    engrave on it, like the engravings of a signet, 'HOLY
    TO YAHWEH.' You shall put it on a lace of blue, and
    it shall be on the sash. It shall be on the front of the
    sash.  It shall be on Aaron's forehead, and Aaron
    shall bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the
    children of Israel shall make holy in all their holy
    gifts; and it shall be always on his forehead, that
    they may be accepted before Yahweh.  You shall
    weave the tunic with fine linen. You shall make a
    turban of fine linen. You shall make a sash, the work
    of the embroiderer.
     'You shall make tunics for Aaron's sons. You
    shall make sashes for them. You shall make headbands for them, for glory and for beauty.  You
    shall put them on Aaron your brother, and on
    his sons with him, and shall anoint them, and
    consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may
    minister to me in the priest's office.  You shall
    make them linen pants to cover their naked flesh.
    They shall reach from the waist even to the thighs.
    They shall be on Aaron and on his sons, when they
    go in to the Tent of Meeting, or when they come
    near to the altar to minister in the holy place, that
    they don't bear iniquity, and die. This shall be a
    statute forever to him and to his offspring after him.
    
     'This is the thing that you shall do to them to
    make them holy, to minister to me in the priest's
    office: take one young bull and two rams without
    defect, unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed
    with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

      
    You shall make them of fine wheat flour.  You
    shall put them into one basket, and bring them in
    the basket, with the bull and the two rams.  You
    shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the
    Tent of Meeting, and shall wash them with water.
     You shall take the garments, and put on Aaron
    the tunic, the robe of the ephod, the ephod, and
    the breastplate, and clothe him with the skillfully
    woven band of the ephod.  You shall set the
    turban on his head, and put the holy crown on the
    turban.  Then you shall take the anointing oil, and
    pour it on his head, and anoint him.  You shall
    bring his sons, and put tunics on them.  You shall
    clothe them with belts, Aaron and his sons, and bind
    headbands on them. They shall have the priesthood
    by a perpetual statute. You shall consecrate Aaron
    and his sons.
     'You shall bring the bull before the Tent of
    Meeting; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their
    hands on the head of the bull.  You shall kill
    the bull before Yahweh at the door of the Tent of
    Meeting.  You shall take of the blood of the bull,
    and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger;
    and you shall pour out all the blood at the base of
    the altar.  You shall take all the fat that covers the
    innards, the cover of the liver, the two kidneys, and
    the fat that is on them, and burn them on the altar.
    But the meat of the bull, and its skin, and its dung,
    you shall burn with fire outside of the camp. It is a
    sin offering.
     'You shall also take the one ram, and Aaron and
    his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram.
    You shall kill the ram, and you shall take its blood,
    and sprinkle it around on the altar.  You shall cut
    the ram into its pieces, and wash its innards, and its
    legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head.
     You shall burn the whole ram on the altar: it is a
    burnt offering to Yahweh; it is a pleasant aroma, an
    offering made by fire to Yahweh.
     'You shall take the other ram, and Aaron and
    his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the
    ram.  Then you shall kill the ram, and take some
    of its blood, and put it on the tip of the right ear of
    Aaron, and on the tip of the right ear of his sons,
    and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the
    big toe of their right foot; and sprinkle the blood
    around on the altar.  You shall take of the blood
    that is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and
    sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments, and on
    his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him:
    and he shall be made holy, and his garments, and
    his sons, and his sons' garments with him.  Also
    you shall take some of the ram's fat, the fat tail, the
    fat that covers the innards, the cover of the liver,
    the two kidneys, the fat that is on them, and the
    right thigh (for it is a ram of consecration),  and
    one loaf of bread, one cake of oiled bread, and one
    wafer out of the basket of unleavened bread that is
    before Yahweh. You shall put all of this in Aaron's
    hands, and in his sons' hands, and shall wave them
    for a wave offering before Yahweh.  You shall take
    them from their hands, and burn them on the altar
    on the burnt offering, for a pleasant aroma before
    Yahweh: it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
     'You shall take the breast of Aaron's ram of
    consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before
    Yahweh. It shall be your portion.  You shall
    sanctify the breast of the wave offering and the
    thigh of the wave offering, which is waved, and
    which is raised up, of the ram of consecration, even
    of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for
    his sons.  it shall be for Aaron and his sons As their
    portion forever from the children of Israel; for it is
    a wave offering. It shall be a wave offering from
    the children of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace
    offerings, even their wave offering to Yahweh.
     'The holy garments of Aaron shall be for his
    sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be
    consecrated in them.  Seven days shall the son
    who is priest in his place put them on, when he
    comes into the Tent of Meeting to minister in the
    holy place.
     'You shall take the ram of consecration and
    boil its meat in a holy place.  Aaron and his sons
    shall eat the meat of the ram, and the bread that
    is in the basket, at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
    They shall eat those things with which atonement
    was made, to consecrate and sanctify them; but a
    stranger shall not eat of it, because they are holy.
     If anything of the meat of the consecration, or of
    the bread, remains to the morning, then you shall
    burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten,
    because it is holy.
     'You shall do so to Aaron and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded you. You shall
    consecrate them seven days.  Every day you shall
    offer the bull of sin offering for atonement. You
    shall cleanse the altar when you make atonement
    for it. You shall anoint it,to sanctify it. Seven days
    you shall make atonement for the altar, and sanctify
    it; and the altar shall be most holy. Whatever
    touches the altar shall be holy.
     'Now this is that which you shall offer on the
    altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually.
     The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and
    the other lamb you shall offer at evening;  and
    with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah* of
    fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of
    beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for
    a drink offering.  The other lamb you shall offer
    at evening, and shall do to it according to the meal
    offering of the morning and according to its drink
    offering, for a pleasant aroma, an offering made
    by fire to Yahweh.  It shall be a continual burnt
    offering throughout your generations at the door
    of the Tent of Meeting before Yahweh, where I will
    meet with you, to speak there to you.  There I
    will meet with the children of Israel; and the place
    shall be sanctified by my glory.  I will sanctify the
    Tent of Meeting and the altar. I will also sanctify
    Aaron and his sons to minister to me in the priest's
    office.  I will dwell among the children of Israel,
    and will be their God.  They shall know that I am

      
    Yahweh their God, who brought them out of the
    land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them: I am
    Yahweh their God.
    
     'You shall make an altar to burn incense on. You
    shall make it of acacia wood.  Its length shall be
    a cubit,* and its width a cubit. It shall be square,
    and its height shall be two cubits. Its horns shall
    be of one piece with it.  You shall overlay it with
    pure gold, its top, its sides around it, and its horns;
    and you shall make a gold molding around it.  You
    shall make two golden rings for it under its molding;
    on its two ribs, on its two sides you shall make
    them; and they shall be for places for poles with
    which to bear it.  You shall make the poles of
    acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.  You
    shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the
    covenant, before the mercy seat that is over the
    covenant, where I will meet with you.  Aaron shall
    burn incense of sweet spices on it every morning.
    When he tends the lamps, he shall burn it.  When
    Aaron lights the lamps at evening, he shall burn it, a
    perpetual incense before Yahweh throughout your
    generations.  You shall offer no strange incense on
    it, nor burnt offering, nor meal offering; and you
    shall pour no drink offering on it.  Aaron shall
    make atonement on its horns once in the year; with
    the blood of the sin offering of atonement once in
    the year he shall make atonement for it throughout
    your generations. It is most holy to Yahweh.'
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'When you
    take a census of the children of Israel, according to
    those who are counted among them, then each man
    shall give a ransom for his soul to Yahweh when you
    count them, that there be no plague among them
    when you count them. They shall give this, everyone who passes over to those who are counted, half
    a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary
    (the shekel is twenty gerahs); half a shekel for an
    offering to Yahweh.  Everyone who passes over to
    those who are counted, from twenty years old and
    upward, shall give the offering to Yahweh.  The
    rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not
    give less, than the half shekel, when they give the
    offering of Yahweh, to make atonement for your
    souls.  You shall take the atonement money from
    the children of Israel, and shall appoint it for the
    service of the Tent of Meeting; that it may be a
    memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh,
    to make atonement for your souls.'
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'You shall
    also make a basin of bronze, and its base of bronze,
    in which to wash. You shall put it between the
    Tent of Meeting and the altar, and you shall put
    water in it.  Aaron and his sons shall wash their
    hands and their feet in it.  When they go into
    the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water,
    that they not die; or when they come near to the
    altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire
    to Yahweh.  So they shall wash their hands and
    their feet, that they not die. This shall be a statute
    forever to them, even to him and to his descendants
    throughout their generations.'
     Moreover Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
     'Also take fine spices: of liquid myrrh, five
    hundred shekels;* and of fragrant cinnamon half as
    much, even two hundred and fifty; and of fragrant
    cane, two hundred and fifty;  and of cassia five
    hundred, according to the shekel of the sanctuary;
    and a hin of olive oil.  You shall make it into a
    holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the
    art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing oil.
     You shall use it to anoint the Tent of Meeting,
    the ark of the covenant,  the table and all its
    articles, the lamp stand and its accessories, the altar
    of incense,  the altar of burnt offering with all
    its utensils, and the basin with its base.  You
    shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy.
    Whatever touches them shall be holy.  You shall
    anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that
    they may minister to me in the priest's office. You
    shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'This
    shall be a holy anointing oil to me throughout your
    generations.  It shall not be poured on man's
    flesh, and do not make any like it, according to its
    composition. It is holy. It shall be holy to you.
     Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts
    any of it on a stranger, he shall be cut off from his
    people.' '
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Take to yourself sweet
    spices, gum resin, onycha, and galbanum: sweet
    spices with pure frankincense. There shall be an
    equal weight of each.  You shall make incense of
    it, a perfume after the art of the perfumer,seasoned
    with salt, pure and holy.  You shall beat some of it
    very small, and put some of it before the covenant
    in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with
    you. It shall be to you most holy.  You shall
    not make this incense, according to its composition,
    for yourselves: it shall be to you holy for Yahweh.
     Whoever shall make any like that, to smell of it,
    he shall be cut off from his people.'
    
    Yahweh spoke to Moses,saying,  'Behold, I have
    called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of
    Hur, of the tribe of Judah.  I have filled him with
    the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding,
    and in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship,
     to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in
    silver, and in bronze,  and in cutting of stones for
    setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds
    of workmanship.  Behold, I myself have appointed
    with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe
    of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted
    I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I
    have commanded you:  the Tent of Meeting, the

      
    ark of the covenant, the mercy seat that is on it, all
    the furniture of the Tent,  the table and its vessels,
    the pure lamp stand with all its vessels, the altar
    of incense,  the altar of burnt offering with all its
    vessels, the basin and its base,  the finely worked
    garments-the holy garments for Aaron the priest,
    the garments of his sons to minister in the priest's
    office-  the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet
    spices for the holy place: according to all that I have
    commanded you they shall do.'
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak also
    to the children of Israel, saying, 'Most certainly you
    shall keep my Sabbaths; for it is a sign between me
    and you throughout your generations, that you may
    know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies you.  You
    shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is holy to
    you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to
    death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul
    shall be cut off from among his people.  Six days
    shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Yahweh. Whoever does
    any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to
    death.  Therefore the children of Israel shall keep
    the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout
    their generations, for a perpetual covenant.  It is a
    sign between me and the children of Israel forever;
    for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and
    on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.' '
     When he finished speaking with him on Mount
    Sinai, he gave Moses the two tablets of the covenant,
    stone tablets, written with God's finger.
    
     When the people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain, the people gathered
    themselves together to Aaron, and said to him,
    'Come, make us gods, which shall go before us; for
    as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of
    the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become
    of him.'
     Aaron said to them, 'Take off the golden rings,
    which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons,
    and of your daughters, and bring them to me.'
     All the people took off the golden rings which
    were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.
     He received what they handed him, fashioned it
    with an engraving tool, and made it a molded calf.
    Then they said, 'These are your gods, Israel, which
    brought you up out of the land of Egypt.'
     When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it;
    and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, 'Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.'
     They rose up early on the next day, and offered
    burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and
    the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up
    to play.
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, 'Go, get down; for
    your people, whom you brought up out of the
    land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves!  They
    have turned away quickly out of the way which
    I commanded them. They have made themselves
    a molded calf, and have worshiped it, and have
    sacrificed to it, and said, 'These are your gods, Israel,
    which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.' '
    Yahweh said to Moses, 'I have seen these people,
    and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.  Now
    therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn
    hot against them, and that I may consume them;
    and I will make of you a great nation.'
     Moses begged Yahweh his God, and said, 'Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your
    people, that you have brought out of the land
    of Egypt with great power and with a mighty
    hand?  Why should the Egyptians talk, saying, 'He
    brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the
    earth?' Turn from your fierce wrath, and turn away
    from this evil against your people.  Remember
    Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom
    you swore by your own self, and said to them, 'I will
    multiply your offspring* as the stars of the sky, and
    all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your
    offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.' '
     So Yahweh turned away from the evil which he
    said he would do to his people.
     Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the covenant in his
    hand; tablets that were written on both their sides.
    They were written on one side and on the other.
     The tablets were the work of God, and the writing
    was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
     When Joshua heard the noise of the people as
    they shouted, he said to Moses, 'There is the noise
    of war in the camp.'
     He said, 'It isn't the voice of those who shout
    for victory. It is not the voice of those who cry for
    being overcome; but the noise of those who sing
    that I hear.' As soon as he came near to the camp,
    he saw the calf and the dancing. Then Moses' anger
    grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands,
    and broke them beneath the mountain.  He took
    the calf which they had made, and burned it with
    fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the
    water, and made the children of Israel drink it.
    Moses said to Aaron, 'What did these people do
    to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?'
    Aaron said, 'Don't let the anger of my lord grow
    hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil.
     for they said to me, 'Make us gods, which shall go
    before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought
    us up out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what
    has become of him.'  I said to them, 'Whoever has
    any gold, let them take it off.' So they gave it to me;
    and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.'
     When Moses saw that the people were out of
    control, (for Aaron had let them lose control,
    causing derision among their enemies),  then Moses
    stood in the gate of the camp, and said, 'Whoever
    is on Yahweh's side, come to me!'
    All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together
    to him.  He said to them, 'Yahweh, the God of
    Israel, says, 'Every man put his sword on his thigh,
    and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout
    the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every
    man his companion, and every man his neighbor.' '

      
     The sons of Levi did according to the word of
    Moses. About three thousand men fell of the people
    that day.  Moses said, 'Consecrate yourselves
    today to Yahweh, for every man was against his
    son and against his brother, that he may give you
    a blessing today.'
    On the next day, Moses said to the people, 'You
    have sinned a great sin. Now I will go up to Yahweh.
    Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin.'
     Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, 'Oh, this
    people have sinned a great sin, and have made
    themselves gods of gold.  Yet now, if you will,
    forgive their sin-and if not, please blot me out of
    your book which you have written.'
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Whoever has sinned
    against me, I will blot him out of my book.  Now
    go, lead the people to the place of which I have
    spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go before you.
    Nevertheless, in the day when I punish, I will punish
    them for their sin.'  Yahweh struck the people,
    because of what they did with the calf, which Aaron
    made.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, 'Depart, go up from
    here, you and the people that you have brought
    up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which
    I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying,
    'I will give it to your offspring.'  I will send an
    angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite,
    the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the
    Hivite, and the Jebusite.  Go to a land flowing with
    milk and honey; but I will not go up among you, for
    you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you on
    the way.'
     When the people heard this evil news, they
    mourned; and no one put on his jewelry.
     Yahweh had said to Moses, 'Tell the children of
    Israel, 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go
    up among you for one moment, I would consume
    you. Therefore now take off your jewelry from you,
    that I may know what to do to you.' '
     The children of Israel stripped themselves of
    their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.
     Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it
    outside the camp, far away from the camp, and
    he called it 'The Tent of Meeting.' Everyone who
    sought Yahweh went out to the Tent of Meeting,
    which was outside the camp.  When Moses went
    out to the Tent, all the people rose up, and stood,
    everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses,
    until he had gone into the Tent.  When Moses
    entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended,
    stood at the door of the Tent, and Yahweh spoke
    with Moses.  All the people saw the pillar of cloud
    stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people
    rose up and worshiped, everyone at their tent door.
     Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a man
    speaksto hisfriend. He turned again into the camp,
    but his servantJoshua, the son of Nun, a young man,
    didn't depart from the Tent.
     Moses said to Yahweh, 'Behold, you tell me,
    'Bring up this people;' and you haven't let me know
    whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I
    know you by name, and you have also found favor
    in my sight.'  Now therefore, if I have found favor
    in your sight, please show me your way, now, that I
    may know you,so that I may find favor in your sight;
    and consider that this nation is your people.'
     He said, 'My presence will go with you, and I
    will give you rest.'
     Moses said to him, 'If your presence doesn't go
    with me, don't carry us up from here.  For how
    would people know that I have found favor in your
    sight, I and your people? Isn't it that you go with us,
    so that we are separated, I and your people, from all
    the people who are on the surface of the earth?'
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'I will do this thing also
    that you have spoken; for you have found favor in
    my sight, and I know you by name.'
     Moses said, 'Please show me your glory.'
     He said, 'I will make all my goodness pass
    before you, and will proclaim Yahweh's name before
    you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious,
    and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.'
    He said, 'You cannot see my face, for man may not
    see me and live.' Yahweh also said, 'Behold,there
    is a place by me, and you shall stand on the rock.  It
    will happen, while my glory passes by, that I will put
    you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my
    hand until I have passed by;  then I will take away
    my hand, and you will see my back; but my face shall
    not be seen.'
    
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Chisel two stone tablets
    like the first. I will write on the tablets the words
    that were on the first tablets, which you broke.  Be
    ready by the morning, and come up in the morning
    to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me
    on the top of the mountain.  No one shall come
    up with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain.
    Do not let the flocks or herds graze in front of that
    mountain.'
     He chiseled two tablets of stone like the first;
    then Moses rose up early in the morning, and went
    up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him,
    and took in his hand two stone tablets.  Yahweh
    descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,
    and proclaimed Yahweh's name.  Yahweh passed
    by before him, and proclaimed, 'Yahweh! Yahweh,
    a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and
    abundant in loving kindness and truth,  keeping
    loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity
    and disobedience and sin; and who will by no means
    clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
    on the children, and on the children's children, on
    the third and on the fourth generation.'
     Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the
    earth, and worshiped. He said, 'If now I have found
    favor in your sight, Lord, please let the Lord go
    among us, even though This is a stiff-necked people;
    pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your
    inheritance.'
     He said, 'Behold, I make a covenant: before
    all your people I will do marvels, such as have not
    been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and
    all the people among whom you are shall see the
      
    work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that
    I do with you.  Observe that which I command
    you today. Behold, I will drive out before you the
    Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite,
    the Hivite, and the Jebusite.  Be careful, lest you
    make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land
    where you are going, lest it be for a snare among
    you;  but you shall break down their altars, and
    dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down
    their Asherah poles;  for you shall worship no
    other god; for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a
    jealous God.
     'Don't make a covenant with the inhabitants
    of the land, lest they play the prostitute after their
    gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call you
    and you eat of his sacrifice;  and you take of their
    daughters to your sons, and their daughters play
    the prostitute after their gods, and make your sons
    play the prostitute after their gods.
     'You shall make no cast idols for yourselves.
     'You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread.
    Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, asI commanded you, at the time appointed in the month
    Abib; for in the month Abib you came out of Egypt.
     'All that opens the womb is mine; and all your
    livestock that is male, the firstborn of cow and
    sheep. You shall redeem the firstborn of a donkey
    with a lamb. If you will not redeem it, then you shall
    break its neck. You shall redeem all the firstborn of
    your sons. No one shall appear before me empty.
     'Six days you shall work, but on the seventh
    day you shall rest: in plowing time and in harvest
    you shall rest.
     'You shall observe the feast of weeks with the
    first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of harvest
    at the year's end.  Three times in the year all your
    males shall appear before the Lord Yahweh, the God
    of Israel.  For I will drive out nations before you
    and enlarge your borders; neither shall any man
    desire your land when you go up to appear before
    Yahweh, your God, three times in the year.
     'You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice
    with leavened bread. The sacrifice of the feast of
    the Passover shall not be left to the morning.
     'You shall bring the first of the first fruits of
    your ground to the house of Yahweh your God.
    'You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's
    milk.'
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Write these words;
    for in accordance with these words I have made a
    covenant with you and with Israel.'
    He was there with Yahweh forty days and forty
    nights; he neither ate bread, nor drank water. He
    wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the
    ten commandments.
    When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with
    the two tablets of the covenant in Moses' hand,
    when he came down from the mountain, Moses
    didn't know that the skin of his face shone by reason
    of his speaking with him.  When Aaron and all
    the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin
    of his face shone; and they were afraid to come
    near him.  Moses called to them, and Aaron and
    all the rulers of the congregation returned to him;
    and Moses spoke to them.  Afterward all the
    children of Israel came near, and he gave them all
    the commandments that Yahweh had spoken with
    him on Mount Sinai.  When Moses was done
    speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.  But
    when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with
    him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he
    came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that
    which he was commanded.  The children of Israel
    saw Moses' face, that the skin of Moses' face shone;
    so Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went
    in to speak with him.
    
     Moses assembled all the congregation of the
    children of Israel, and said to them, 'These are
    the words which Yahweh has commanded, that you
    should do them.  'Six days shall work be done, but
    on the seventh day there shall be a holy day for you,
    a Sabbath of solemn rest to Yahweh: whoever does
    any work in it shall be put to death.  You shall
    kindle no fire throughout your habitations on the
    Sabbath day.' '
     Moses spoke to all the congregation of the
    children of Israel, saying, 'This is the thing which
    Yahweh commanded, saying,  'Take from among
    you an offering to Yahweh. Whoever is of a willing
    heart, let him bring it as Yahweh's offering: gold,
    silver, bronze,  blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen,
    goats' hair,  rams' skins dyed red, sea cow hides,
    acacia wood,  oil for the light,spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense,  onyx stones,
    and stones to be set for the ephod and for the
    breastplate.
     ' 'Let every wise-hearted man among you
    come, and make all that Yahweh has commanded:
     the tabernacle, its outer covering, its roof, its
    clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;
     the ark, and its poles, the mercy seat, the veil
    of the screen;  the table with its poles and all its
    vessels, and the show bread;  the lamp stand also
    for the light, with its vessels, its lamps, and the
    oil for the light;  and the altar of incense with
    its poles, the anointing oil, the sweet incense, the
    screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle;
     the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of
    bronze, its poles, and all its vessels, the basin and its
    base;  the hangings of the court, its pillars, their
    sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court;
     the pins of the tabernacle, the pins of the court,
    and their cords;  the finely worked garments for
    ministering in the holy place-the holy garments
    for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons
    -to minister in the priest's office.' '
     All the congregation of the children of Israel
    departed from the presence of Moses. They came,
    everyone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone
    whom his spirit made willing, and brought Yahweh's offering for the work of the Tent of Meeting,
    and for all of its service, and for the holy garments.
     They came, both men and women, as many as
    were willing-hearted, and brought brooches, earrings, signet rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold;
    even every man who offered an offering of gold
      
    to Yahweh.  Everyone with whom was found
    blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair, rams'
    skins dyed red, and sea cow hides, brought them.
     Everyone who offered an offering of silver and
    bronze brought Yahweh's offering; and everyone
    with whom was found acacia wood for any work of
    the service, brought it.  All the women who were
    wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought
    that which they had spun: the blue, the purple,
    the scarlet, and the fine linen.  All the women
    whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the
    goats' hair.  The rulers brought the onyx stones
    and the stones to be set for the ephod and for
    the breastplate;  with the spice and the oil for
    the light, for the anointing oil, and for the sweet
    incense.  The children of Israel brought a free
    will offering to Yahweh; every man and woman
    whose heart made them willing to bring for all the
    work, which Yahweh had commanded to be made
    by Moses.
     Moses said to the children of Israel, 'Behold,
    Yahweh has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri,
    the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.  He has
    filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in
    understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of
    workmanship;  and to make skillful works, to
    work in gold, in silver, in bronze,  in cutting of
    stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work
    in all kinds of skillful workmanship.  He has
    put in his heart that he may teach, both he and
    Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
     He has filled them with wisdom of heart to work
    all kinds of workmanship, of the engraver, of the
    skillful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue,
    in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the
    weaver, even of those who do any workmanship,
    and of those who make skillful works.
    
     'Bezalel and Oholiab shall work with every wise hearted man, in whom Yahweh has put wisdom and
    understanding to know how to do all the work for
    the service of the sanctuary, according to all that
    Yahweh has commanded.'
     Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every
    wise-hearted man, in whose heart Yahweh had put
    wisdom, even everyone whose heart stirred him
    up to come to the work to do it.  They received
    from Moses all the offering which the children of
    Israel had brought for the work of the service of the
    sanctuary, with which to make it. They kept bringing free will offerings to him every morning.  All
    the wise men, who performed all the work of the
    sanctuary, each came from his work which he did.
     They spoke to Moses, saying, 'The people have
    brought much more than enough for the service of
    the work which Yahweh commanded to make.'
     Moses gave a commandment, and they caused
    it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying,
    'Let neither man nor woman make anything else
    for the offering for the sanctuary.' So the people
    were restrained from bringing.  For the stuff they
    had was sufficient to do all the work, and too much.
     All the wise-hearted men among those who did
    the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains of
    fine twined linen, blue, purple, and scarlet. They
    made them with cherubim, the work of a skillful
    workman.  The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits,* and the width of each curtain four
    cubits. All the curtains had one measure.  He
    coupled five curtains to one another, and the other
    five curtains he coupled to one another. He made
    loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain from the
    edge in the coupling. Likewise he made in the edge
    of the curtain that was outermost in the second
    coupling.  He made fifty loops in the one curtain,
    and he made fifty loops in the edge of the curtain
    that was in the second coupling. The loops were
    opposite to one another.  He made fifty clasps of
    gold, and coupled the curtains to one another with
    the clasps: so the tabernacle was a unit.
     He made curtains of goats' hair for a covering
    over the tabernacle. He made them eleven curtains.
     The length of each curtain was thirty cubits,
    and four cubits the width of each curtain. The
    eleven curtains had one measure.  He coupled
    five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by
    themselves.  He made fifty loops on the edge of
    the curtain that was outermost in the coupling, and
    he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain which
    was outermost in the second coupling.  He made
    fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together,
    that it might be a unit.  He made a covering for
    the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of
    sea cow hides above.
    He made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia
    wood, standing up.  Ten cubits was the length
    of a board, and a cubit and a half the width of
    each board.  Each board had two tenons, joined
    to one another. He made all the boards of the
    tabernacle this way.  He made the boards for
    the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side
    southward. He made forty sockets of silver under
    the twenty boards: two sockets under one board
    for its two tenons, and two sockets under another
    board for its two tenons.  For the second side of
    the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty
    boards  and their forty sockets of silver: two
    sockets under one board, and two sockets under
    another board.  For the far part of the tabernacle
    westward he made six boards.  He made two
    boards for the corners of the tabernacle in the far
    part.  They were double beneath, and in the same
    way they were all the way to its top to one ring. He
    did this to both of them in the two corners.  There
    were eight boards and their sockets of silver,sixteen
    sockets-under every board two sockets.
     He made bars of acacia wood: five for the
    boards of the one side of the tabernacle,  and
    five bars for the boards of the other side of the
    tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the
    tabernacle for the hinder part westward. He made
    the middle bar to pass through in the middle of the

      
    boards from the one end to the other. He overlaid
    the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold as
    places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
     He made the veil of blue, purple, scarlet, and
    fine twined linen, with cherubim. He made it the
    work of a skillful workman.  He made four pillars
    of acacia for it, and overlaid them with gold. Their
    hooks were of gold. He cast four sockets of silver
    for them.  He made a screen for the door of the
    tent, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen,
    the work of an embroiderer;  and the five pillars
    of it with their hooks. He overlaid their capitals and
    their fillets with gold, and their five sockets were of
    bronze.
    
     Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood. Its length
    was two and a half cubits,* and its width a cubit
    and a half, and a cubit and a half its height.  He
    overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and
    made a molding of gold for it around it.  He cast
    four rings of gold for it in its four feet-two rings
    on its one side, and two rings on its other side.  He
    made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with
    gold.  He put the poles into the rings on the sides
    of the ark, to bear the ark.  He made a mercy seat
    of pure gold. Its length was two and a half cubits,
    and a cubit and a half its width.  He made two
    cherubim of gold. He made them of beaten work, at
    the two ends of the mercy seat:  one cherub at the
    one end, and one cherub at the other end. He made
    the cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at its
    two ends.  The cherubim spread out their wings
    above, covering the mercy seat with their wings,
    with their faces toward one another. The faces of
    the cherubim were toward the mercy seat.
     He made the table of acacia wood. Its length
    was two cubits, and its width was a cubit, and its
    height was a cubit and a half.  He overlaid it with
    pure gold, and made a gold molding around it. He
    made a border of a hand's width around it, and made
    a golden molding on its border around it. He cast
    four rings of gold for it, and put the rings in the four
    corners that were on its four feet.  The rings were
    close by the border, the places for the poles to carry
    the table.  He made the poles of acacia wood, and
    overlaid them with gold, to carry the table.  He
    made the vessels which were on the table, its dishes,
    its spoons, its bowls, and its pitchers with which to
    pour out, of pure gold.
    He made the lamp stand of pure gold. He made
    the lamp stand of beaten work. Its base, its shaft, its
    cups, its buds, and its flowers were of one piece with
    it.  There were six branches going out of its sides:
    three branches of the lamp stand out of its one side,
    and three branches of the lamp stand out of its other
    side:  three cups made like almond blossoms in
    one branch, a bud and a flower, and three cups made
    like almond blossoms in the other branch, a bud and
    a flower; so for the six branches going out of the
    lamp stand.  In the lamp stand were four cups
    made like almond blossoms, its buds and its flowers;
     and a bud under two branches of one piece with
    it, and a bud under two branches of one piece with
    it, and a bud under two branches of one piece with
    it, for the six branches going out of it.  Their buds
    and their branches were of one piece with it. The
    whole thing was one beaten work of pure gold. He
    made its seven lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff
    dishes, of pure gold.  He made it of a talent of
    pure gold, with all its vessels.
    He made the altar of incense of acacia wood. It
    was square: its length was a cubit, and its width a
    cubit. Its height was two cubits. Its horns were of
    one piece with it.  He overlaid it with pure gold:
    its top, its sides around it, and its horns. He made a
    gold molding around it. He made two golden rings
    for it underits molding crown, on itstwo ribs, on its
    two sides, for places for poles with which to carry it.
     He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid
    them with gold.  He made the holy anointing oil
    and the pure incense of sweet spices, after the art of
    the perfumer.
    
     He made the altar of burnt offering of acacia
    wood. It was square. Its length was five cubits,*
    its width was five cubits, and its height was three
    cubits.  He made its horns on its four corners. Its
    horns were of one piece with it, and he overlaid
    it with bronze.  He made all the vessels of the
    altar: the pots, the shovels, the basins, the forks,
    and the fire pans. He made all its vessels of bronze.
     He made for the altar a grating of a network of
    bronze, under the ledge around it beneath,reaching
    halfway up. He cast four rings for the four corners
    of bronze grating, to be places for the poles.  He
    made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them
    with bronze. He put the poles into the rings on the
    sides of the altar, with which to carry it. He made it
    hollow with planks.
     He made the basin of bronze, and its base
    of bronze, out of the mirrors of the ministering
    women who ministered at the door of the Tent of
    Meeting.
    He made the court: for the south side southward
    the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen,
    one hundred cubits;  their pillars were twenty, and
    their sockets twenty, of bronze; the hooks of the
    pillars and their fillets were of silver.  For the
    north side one hundred cubits, their pillars twenty,
    and their sockets twenty, of bronze; the hooks of
    the pillars, and their fillets, of silver.  For the west
    side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten,
    and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars, and
    their fillets, of silver.  For the east side eastward
    fifty cubits,  the hangings for the one side were
    fifteen cubits; their their sockets three, and their sockets
    three;  and so for the other side: on this hand and
    that hand by the gate of the court were hangings of
    fifteen cubits; their their sockets three, and their sockets

      
    three.  All the hangings around the court were of
    fine twined linen.  The sockets for the pillars were
    of bronze. The hooks of the pillars and their fillets
    were of silver. Their capitals were overlaid with
    silver. All the pillars of the court had silver bands.
     The screen for the gate of the court was the work
    of the embroiderer, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine
    twined linen. Twenty cubits was the length, and
    the height along the width was five cubits, like the
    hangings of the court.  Their pillars were four,
    and their sockets four, of bronze; their hooks of
    silver, and the overlaying of their capitals, and their
    fillets, of silver. All the pins of the tabernacle, and
    around the court, were of bronze.
    These are the amounts of materials used for the
    tabernacle, even the Tabernacle of the Testimony,
    as they were counted, according to the commandment of Moses,
    for the service of the Levites, by
    the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
     Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe
    of Judah, made all that Yahweh commanded Moses.
     With him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach,
    of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a skillful
    workman, and an embroiderer in blue, in purple, in
    scarlet, and in fine linen.
     All the gold that was used for the work in all
    the work of the sanctuary, even the gold of the
    offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred thirty shekels, according to the shekel of the
    sanctuary.  The silver of those who were counted
    of the congregation was one hundred talents and
    one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels,*
    according to the shekel of the sanctuary:  a beka a
    head, that is, half a shekel, according to the shekel
    of the sanctuary, for everyone who passed over to
    those who were counted, from twenty years old
    and upward, for six hundred three thousand five
    hundred fifty men.  The one hundred talents of
    silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary
    and the sockets of the veil: one hundred sockets
    for the one hundred talents, one talent per socket.
     From the one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels* he made hooks for the pillars, overlaid
    their capitals, and made fillets for them.  The
    bronze of the offering was seventy talents and two
    thousand four hundred shekels.  With this he
    made the sockets to the door of the Tent of Meeting,
    the bronze altar, the bronze grating for it, all the
    vessels of the altar,  the sockets around the court,
    the sockets of the gate of the court, all the pins of
    the tabernacle, and all the pins around the court.
    
    of the blue, purple, and scarlet,they made finely
    worked garments for ministering in the holy place,
    and made the holy garments for Aaron, as Yahweh
    commanded Moses.
    He made the ephod of gold, blue, purple,scarlet,
    and fine twined linen.  They beat the gold into
    thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in with
    the blue, the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen,
    the work of the skillful workman.  They made
    shoulder straps for it, joined together. It was joined
    together at the two ends.  The skillfully woven
    band that was on it, with which to fasten it on, was
    of the same piece, like its work: of gold, of blue,
    purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, as Yahweh
    commanded Moses.
     They worked the onyx stones, enclosed in settings of gold, engraved with the engravings of a
    signet, according to the names of the children of
    Israel.  He put them on the shoulder straps of the
    ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of
    Israel, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
     He made the breastplate, the work of a skillful
    workman, like the work of the ephod: of gold, of
    blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.  It
    was square. They made the breastplate double. Its
    length was a span,* and its width a span, being
    double.  They set in it four rows of stones. A row
    of ruby, topaz, and beryl was the first row;  and
    the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and an
    emerald;  and the third row, a jacinth, an agate,
    and an amethyst;  and the fourth row, a chrysolite,
    an onyx, and a jasper. They were enclosed in
    gold settings.  The stones were according to the
    names of the children of Israel, twelve, according
    to their names; like the engravings of a signet,
    everyone according to his name, for the twelve
    tribes.  They made on the breastplate chains like
    cords, of braided work of pure gold.  They made
    two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put
    the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.
    They put the two braided chains of gold in the two
    rings at the ends of the breastplate. The other two
    ends of the two braided chains they put on the two
    settings, and put them on the shoulder straps of the
    ephod, in its front.  They made two rings of gold,
    and put them on the two ends of the breastplate,
    on its edge, which was toward the side of the ephod
    inward.  They made two more rings of gold, and
    put them on the two shoulder straps of the ephod
    underneath, in its front, close by its coupling, above
    the skillfully woven band of the ephod.  They
    bound the breastplate by its rings to the rings of
    the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be on
    the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the
    breastplate might not come loose from the ephod,
    as Yahweh commanded Moses.
    He made the robe of the ephod of woven work,
    all of blue.  The opening of the robe in the middle

      
    of it was like the opening of a coat of mail, with
    a binding around its opening, that it should not
    be torn.  They made on the skirts of the robe
    pomegranates of blue, purple, scarlet, and twined
    linen.  They made bells of pure gold, and put the
    bells between the pomegranates around the skirts
    of the robe, between the pomegranates;  a bell and
    a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, around
    the skirts of the robe, to minister in, as Yahweh
    commanded Moses.
     They made the tunics of fine linen of woven
    work for Aaron and for his sons,  the turban of
    fine linen, the linen headbands of fine linen, the
    linen trousers of fine twined linen,  the sash of fine
    twined linen, blue, purple, and scarlet, the work of
    the embroiderer, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
     They made the plate of the holy crown of pure
    gold, and wrote on it an inscription, like the engravings of a signet:
    'HOLY TO YAHWEH'.  They tied
    to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on the turban above,
    as Yahweh commanded Moses.
     Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the Tent
    of Meeting was finished. The children of Israel did
    according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses; so
    they did.  They brought the tabernacle to Moses:
    the tent, with all its furniture, its clasps, its boards,
    its bars, its pillars, its sockets,  the covering of
    rams' skins dyed red, the covering of sea cow hides,
    the veil of the screen,  the ark of the covenant
    with its poles, the mercy seat,  the table, all its
    vessels, the show bread,  the pure lamp stand, its
    lamps, even the lamps to be set in order, all its
    vessels, the oil for the light,  the golden altar, the
    anointing oil, the sweet incense, the screen for the
    door of the Tent,  the bronze altar, its grating of
    bronze, its poles, all of its vessels, the basin and
    its base,  the hangings of the court, its pillars,
    its sockets, the screen for the gate of the court, its
    cords, its pins, and all the instruments of the service
    of the tabernacle, for the Tent of Meeting,  the
    finely worked garments for ministering in the holy
    place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and
    the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's
    office.  According to all that Yahweh commanded
    Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work.
     Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had
    done it as Yahweh had commanded. They had done
    so; and Moses blessed them.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'On the first
    day of the first month you shall raise up the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting.  You shall put the ark
    of the covenant in it, and you shall screen the ark
    with the veil.  You shall bring in the table, and set
    in order the things that are on it. You shall bring
    in the lamp stand, and light its lamps.  You shall
    set the golden altar for incense before the ark of
    the covenant, and put the screen of the door to the
    tabernacle.
     'You shall set the altar of burnt offering before
    the door of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting.
     You shall set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and shall put water therein.  You
    shall set up the court around it, and hang up the
    screen of the gate of the court.
     'You shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the
    tabernacle and all that is in it, and shall make it holy,
    and all its furniture, and it will be holy.  You shall
    anoint the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels,
    and sanctify the altar, and the altar will be most
    holy.  You shall anoint the basin and its base, and
    sanctify it.
     'You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door
    of the Tent of Meeting, and shall wash them with
    water.  You shall put on Aaron the holy garments;
    and you shall anoint him, and sanctify him, that he
    may minister to me in the priest's office.  You
    shall bring his sons, and put tunics on them.  You
    shall anoint them, as you anointed their father,
    that they may minister to me in the priest's office.
    Their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting
    priesthood throughout their generations.' Moses
    did so. According to all that Yahweh commanded
    him, so he did.
     In the first month in the second year, on the
    first day of the month, the tabernacle was raised
    up.  Moses raised up the tabernacle, and laid its
    sockets, and set up its boards, and put in its bars,
    and raised up its pillars.  He spread the covering
    over the tent, and put the roof of the tabernacle
    above on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  He
    took and put the covenant into the ark, and set the
    poles on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on
    the ark.  He brought the ark into the tabernacle,
    and set up the veil of the screen, and screened
    the ark of the covenant, as Yahweh commanded
    Moses.  He put the table in the Tent of Meeting,
    on the north side of the tabernacle, outside of the
    veil.  He set the bread in order on it before
    Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  He put
    the lamp stand in the Tent of Meeting, opposite the
    table, on the south side of the tabernacle.  He lit
    the lamps before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded
    Moses.  He put the golden altar in the Tent of
    Meeting before the veil;  and he burned incense
    of sweet spices on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
    He put up the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
    He set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the
    tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it
    the burnt offering and the meal offering, as Yahweh
    commanded Moses.  He set the basin between
    the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water
    therein, with which to wash.  Moses, Aaron, and
    his sons washed their hands and their feet there.
     When they went into the Tent of Meeting, and
    when they came near to the altar, they washed, as
    Yahweh commanded Moses.  He raised up the
    court around the tabernacle and the altar, and set
    up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses
    finished the work.
     Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting,
    and Yahweh's glory filled the tabernacle.  Moses
    wasn't able to enter into the Tent of Meeting,
    because the cloud stayed on it, and Yahweh's glory
    filled the tabernacle.  When the cloud was taken
    up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel
    went onward, throughout all their journeys;  but
      
    if the cloud wasn't taken up, then they didn't travel
    until the day that it was taken up.  For the cloud
    of Yahweh was on the tabernacle by day, and there
    was fire in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the
    house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
      
    The Third Book of Moses,
    Commonly Called
    Leviticus:
    
    Yahweh* called to Moses, and spoke to him from
    the Tent of Meeting,saying,  'Speak to the children
    of Israel, and tell them, 'When anyone of you offers
    an offering to Yahweh, you shall offer your offering
    of the livestock, from the herd and from the flock.
     ' 'If his offering is a burnt offering from the
    herd, he shall offer a male without defect. He shall
    offer it at the door of the Tent of Meeting, that he
    may be accepted before Yahweh.  He shall lay his
    hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall
    be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
     He shall kill the bull before Yahweh. Aaron's sons,
    the priests, shall present the blood and sprinkle the
    blood around on the altar that is at the door of the
    Tent of Meeting.  He shall skin the burnt offering
    and cut it into pieces.  The sons of Aaron the priest
    shall put fire on the altar, and lay wood in order on
    the fire;  and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the
    pieces, the head, and the fat in order on the wood
    that is on the fire which is on the altar;  but he shall
    wash its innards and its legs with water. The priest
    shall burn all of it on the altar, for a burnt offering,
    an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to
    Yahweh.
     ' 'If his offering is from the flock, from the
    sheep or from the goats, for a burnt offering, he
    shall offer a male without defect. He shall kill it on
    the north side of the altar before Yahweh. Aaron's
    sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood around on
    the altar.  He shall cut it into its pieces, with its
    head and its fat. The priest shall lay them in order
    on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar,
     but the innards and the legs he shall wash with
    water. The priest shall offer the whole, and burn it
    on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering made
    by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.
     ' 'If his offering to Yahweh is a burnt offering
    of birds, then he shall offer his offering from turtledoves or of young pigeons.  The priest shall bring
    it to the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on
    the altar; and its blood shall be drained out on the
    side of the altar;  and he shall take away its crop
    and its feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the
    east part, in the place of the ashes. He shall tear it
    by its wings, but shall not divide it apart. The priest
    shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the
    fire. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire,
    of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.
    
     ' 'When anyone offers an offering of a meal
    offering to Yahweh, his offering shall be of fine
    flour. He shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense
    on it. He shall bring it to Aaron's sons, the priests.
    He shall take his handful of its fine flour, and of its
    oil, with all its frankincense, and the priest shall
    burn its memorial on the altar, an offering made by
    fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.  That which
    is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron's and his
    sons'. It is a most holy part of the offerings of
    Yahweh made by fire.
     ' 'When you offer an offering of a meal offering
    baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes
    of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers
    anointed with oil.  If your offering is a meal
    offering made on a griddle, it shall be of unleavened
    fine flour, mixed with oil.  You shall cut it in
    pieces, and pour oil on it. It is a meal offering.  If
    your offering is a meal offering of the pan, it shall
    be made of fine flour with oil.  You shall bring
    the meal offering that is made of these things to
    Yahweh. It shall be presented to the priest, and he
    shall bring it to the altar.  The priest shall take
    from the meal offering its memorial, and shall burn
    it on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant
    aroma to Yahweh.  That which is left of the meal
    offering shall be Aaron's and his sons'. It is a most
    holy part of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.
     ' 'No meal offering which you shall offer to
    Yahweh shall be made with yeast; for you shall burn
    no yeast, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire
    to Yahweh.  As an offering of first fruits you shall
    offer them to Yahweh, but they shall not rise up as
    a pleasant aroma on the altar.  Every offering of
    your meal offering you shall season with salt. You
    shall not allow the salt of the covenant of your God*
    to be lacking from your meal offering. With all your
    offerings you shall offer salt.
     ' 'If you offer a meal offering of first fruits to
    Yahweh, you shall offer for the meal offering of
    your first fruits fresh heads of grain parched with
    fire and crushed.  You shall put oil on it and lay
    frankincense on it. it is a meal offering. The priest
    shall burn as its memorial part of its crushed grain
    and part of its oil, along with all its frankincense. It
    is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
    
     ' 'If his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings,
    if he offers it from the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without defect before Yahweh.
     He shall lay his hand on the head of his offering,
    and kill it at the door of the Tent of Meeting. Aaron's
    sons, the priests, shall sprinkle the blood around on
    the altar.  He shall offer of the sacrifice of peace
    offerings an offering made by fire to Yahweh. The
    fat that covers the innards, and all the fat that is
    on the innards,  and the two kidneys, and the fat
    that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover
    on the liver, with the kidneys, he shall take away.
    Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar on the burnt
    offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire: it
    is an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to
    Yahweh.
     ' 'If his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings
    to Yahweh is from the flock, either male or female,
    he shall offer it without defect.  If he offers a
    lamb for his offering, then he shall offer it before

      
    Yahweh;  and he shall lay his hand on the head of
    his offering, and kill it before the Tent of Meeting.
    Aaron's sons shall sprinkle its blood around on the
    altar.  He shall offer from the sacrifice of peace
    offerings an offering made by fire to Yahweh; its
    fat, the entire tail fat, he shall take away close to
    the backbone; and the fat that covers the entrails,
    and all the fat that is on the entrails,  and the two
    kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the
    loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys,
    he shall take away.  The priest shall burn it on the
    altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire to
    Yahweh.
     ' 'If his offering is a goat, then he shall offer
    it before Yahweh.  He shall lay his hand on its
    head, and kill it before the Tent of Meeting; and the
    sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood around on the
    altar.  He shall offer from it as his offering, an
    offering made by fire to Yahweh; the fat that covers
    the innards, and all the fat that is on the innards,
     and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them,
    which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver,
    with the kidneys, he shall take away.  The priest
    shall burn them on the altar: it is the food of the
    offering made by fire, for a pleasant aroma; all the
    fat is Yahweh's.
     ' 'It shall be a perpetual statute throughout
    your generations in all your dwellings, that you
    shall eat neither fat nor blood.' '
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to the
    children of Israel, saying, 'If anyone sins unintentionally, in any of the things which Yahweh has
    commanded not to be done, and does any one of
    them,  if the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt
    on the people,then let him offer for his sin which he
    has sinned a young bull without defect to Yahweh
    for a sin offering.  He shall bring the bull to the
    door of the Tent of Meeting before Yahweh; and
    he shall lay his hand on the head of the bull, and
    kill the bull before Yahweh.  The anointed priest
    shall take some of the blood of the bull, and bring
    it to the Tent of Meeting.  The priest shall dip his
    finger in the blood, and sprinkle some of the blood
    seven times before Yahweh, before the veil of the
    sanctuary.  The priest shall put some of the blood
    on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before
    Yahweh, which is in the Tent of Meeting; and he
    shall pour out the rest of the blood of the bull at
    the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at
    the door of the Tent of Meeting.  He shall take all
    the fat of the bull of the sin offering from it: the
    fat that covers the innards, and all the fat that is on
    the innards,  and the two kidneys, and the fat that
    is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on
    the liver, with the kidneys, he shall remove,  as it
    is removed from the bull of the sacrifice of peace
    offerings. The priest shall burn them on the altar of
    burnt offering.  He shall carry the bull's skin, all
    its meat, with its head, and with its legs, its innards,
    and its dung  -all the rest of the bull -outside
    of the camp to a clean place where the ashes are
    poured out, and burn it on wood with fire. It shall
    be burned where the ashes are poured out.
     ' 'If the whole congregation of Israel sins, and
    the thing is hidden from the eyes of the assembly,
    and they have done any of the things which Yahweh
    has commanded not to be done, and are guilty;
     when the sin in which they have sinned is known,
    then the assembly shall offer a young bull for a sin
    offering, and bring it before the Tent of Meeting.
     The elders of the congregation shall lay their
    hands on the head of the bull before Yahweh; and
    the bull shall be killed before Yahweh.  The
    anointed priest shall bring some of the blood of the
    bull to the Tent of Meeting.  The priest shall dip
    his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times
    before Yahweh, before the veil. He shall put some
    of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before
    Yahweh, that is in the Tent of Meeting; and the rest
    of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar
    of burnt offering, which is at the door of the Tent of
    Meeting.  All its fat he shall take from it, and burn
    it on the altar. He shall do this with the bull; as he
    did with the bull of the sin offering, so he shall do
    with this; and the priest shall make atonement for
    them, and they shall be forgiven.  He shall carry
    the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned
    the first bull. It is the sin offering for the assembly.
     ' 'When a ruler sins, and unwittingly does any
    one of all the things which Yahweh his God has
    commanded not to be done, and is guilty,  if his
    sin in which he has sinned is made known to him,
    he shall bring as his offering a goat, a male without
    defect.  He shall lay his hand on the head of the
    goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the
    burnt offering before Yahweh. It is a sin offering.
     The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin
    offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of
    the altar of burnt offering. He shall pour out the rest
    of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering.
     All its fat he shall burn on the altar, like the fat of
    the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall
    make atonement for him concerning his sin, and he
    will be forgiven.
     ' 'If anyone of the common people sins unwittingly, in doing any of the things which Yahweh has
    commanded not to be done, and is guilty,  if his sin
    which he has sinned is made known to him, then he
    shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without
    defect, for his sin which he has sinned.  He shall
    lay his hand on the head of the sin offering, and
    kill the sin offering in the place of burnt offering.
     The priest shall take some of its blood with his
    finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt
    offering; and the rest of its blood he shall pour out
    at the base of the altar.  All its fat he shall take
    away, like the fat is taken away from the sacrifice
    of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it on
    the altar for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh; and the
    priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be
    forgiven.
     ' 'If he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin
    offering, he shall bring a female without defect.
     He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin
    offering, and kill it for a sin offering in the place
      
    where they kill the burnt offering.  The priest
    shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with
    his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of
    burnt offering; and all the rest of its blood he shall
    pour out at the base of the altar.  He shall remove
    all its fat, like the fat of the lamb is removed from the
    sacrifice of peace offerings. The priest shall burn
    them on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh made
    by fire. The priest shall make atonement for him
    concerning his sin that he has sinned, and he will
    be forgiven.
    
     ' 'If anyone sins, in that he hears a public
    adjuration to testify, he being a witness, whether he
    has seen or known, if he doesn't report it, then he
    shall bear his iniquity.
     ' 'Or if anyone touches any unclean thing,
    whether it is the carcass of an unclean animal, or
    the carcass of unclean livestock, or the carcass of
    unclean creeping things, and it is hidden from him,
    and he is unclean, then he shall be guilty.
     ' 'Or if he touches the uncleanness of man,
    whatever his uncleanness is with which he is unclean, and it is hidden from him; when he knows of
    it, then he shall be guilty.
     ' 'Or if anyone swears rashly with his lips to do
    evil or to do good-whatever it is that a man might
    utter rashly with an oath, and it is hidden from him
    -when he knows of it, then he will be guilty of one
    of these.  It shall be, when he is guilty of one of
    these, he shall confess that in which he has sinned;
     and he shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh
    for his sin which he has sinned: a female from the
    flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin offering; and the
    priest shall make atonement for him concerning his
    sin.
     ' 'If he can't afford a lamb, then he shall bring
    his trespass offering for that in which he has sinned,
    two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to Yahweh;
    one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt
    offering.  He shall bring them to the priest, who
    shall first offer the one which is for the sin offering.
    He shall wring off its head from its neck, but shall
    not sever it completely.  He shall sprinkle some
    of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the
    altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out
    at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering. He shall
    offer the second for a burnt offering, according to
    the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement
    for him concerning his sin which he has sinned, and
    he shall be forgiven.
     ' 'But if he can't afford two turtledoves or two
    young pigeons, then he shall bring as his offering
    for that in which he has sinned, one tenth of an
    ephah* of fine flour for a sin offering. He shall put
    no oil on it, and he shall not put any frankincense
    on it, for it is a sin offering.  He shall bring it to
    the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it
    as the memorial portion, and burn it on the altar,
    on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. It is a sin
    offering. The priest shall make atonement for him
    concerning his sin that he has sinned in any of these
    things, and he will be forgiven; and the rest shall be
    the priest's, as the meal offering.' '
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'If anyone
    commits a trespass, and sins unwittingly regarding
    Yahweh's holy things, then he shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh: a ram without defect from
    the flock, according to your estimation in silver by
    shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary,
    for a trespass offering.  He shall make restitution
    for that which he has done wrong regarding the
    holy thing, and shall add a fifth part to it, and give it
    to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement
    for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and
    he will be forgiven.
     'If anyone sins, doing any of the things which
    Yahweh has commanded not to be done, though
    he didn't know it, he is still guilty, and shall bear
    his iniquity.  He shall bring a ram without defect
    from of the flock, according to your estimation, for
    a trespass offering, to the priest; and the priest shall
    make atonement for him concerning the thing in
    which he sinned and didn't know it, and he will be
    forgiven.  It is a trespass offering. He is certainly
    guilty before Yahweh.'
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'If anyone
    sins, and commits a trespass against Yahweh, and
    deals falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of bargain, or of robbery, or has oppressed
    his neighbor,  or has found that which was lost, and
    lied about it, and swearing to a lie-in any of these
    things that a man sins in his actions-  then it shall
    be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, he shall restore
    that which he took by robbery, or the thing which
    he has gotten by oppression, or the deposit which
    was committed to him, or the lost thing which he
    found,  or any thing about which he has sworn
    falsely: he shall restore it in full, and shall add a
    fifth part more to it. He shall return it to him to
    whom it belongs in the day of his being found guilty.
     He shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh:
    a ram without defect from the flock, according
    to your estimation, for a trespass offering, to the
    priest.  The priest shall make atonement for him
    before Yahweh, and he will be forgiven concerning
    whatever he does to become guilty.'
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Command
    Aaron and his sons, saying, 'This is the law of the
    burnt offering: the burnt offering shall be on the
    hearth on the altar all night until the morning; and
    the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it.
     The priest shall put on his linen garment, and
    he shall put on his linen trousers upon his body;
    and he shall remove the ashes from where the fire
    has consumed the burnt offering on the altar, and
    he shall put them beside the altar.  He shall take
    off his garments, and put on other garments, and
    carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.
     The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it,
    it shall not go out; and the priest shall burn wood

      
    on it every morning. He shall lay the burnt offering
    in order upon it, and shall burn on it the fat of the
    peace offerings.  Fire shall be kept burning on the
    altar continually; it shall not go out.
     ' 'This is the law of the meal offering: the sons
    of Aaron shall offer it before Yahweh, before the
    altar.  He shall take from there his handful of the
    fine flour of the meal offering, and of its oil, and all
    the frankincense which is on the meal offering, and
    shall burn it on the altar for a pleasant aroma, as its
    memorial portion, to Yahweh.  That which is left
    of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. It shall be eaten
    without yeast in a holy place. They shall eat it in
    the court of the Tent of Meeting.  It shall not be
    baked with yeast. I have given it as their portion of
    my offerings made by fire. It is most holy, as are the
    sin offering and the trespass offering.  Every male
    among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as their
    portion forever throughout your generations, from
    the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. Whoever
    touches them shall be holy.' '
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'This is the
    offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall
    offer to Yahweh in the day when he is anointed: one
    tenth of an ephah* of fine flour for a meal offering
    perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half of
    it in the evening.  It shall be made with oil in a
    griddle. When it is soaked, you shall bring it in.
    You shall offer the meal offering in baked pieces
    for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.  The anointed
    priest that will be in his place from among his sons
    shall offer it. By a statute forever, it shall be wholly
    burned to Yahweh.  Every meal offering of a priest
    shall be wholly burned. It shall not be eaten.'
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to
    Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is the law of the
    sin offering: in the place where the burnt offering is
    killed,the sin offering shall be killed before Yahweh.
    It is most holy.  The priest who offers it for sin
    shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place, in
    the court of the Tent of Meeting.  Whatever shall
    touch its flesh shall be holy. When there is any of its
    blood sprinkled on a garment, you shall wash that
    on which it was sprinkled in a holy place.  But the
    earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken;
    and if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, it shall be
    scoured, and rinsed in water.  Every male among
    the priests shall eat of it. It is most holy.  No sin
    offering, of which any of the blood is brought into
    the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy
    Place, shall be eaten. It shall be burned with fire.
    
     ' 'This is the law of the trespass offering: It is
    most holy.  In the place where they kill the burnt
    offering, he shall kill the trespass offering; and its
    blood he shall sprinkle around on the altar.  He
    shall offer all of its fat: the fat tail, and the fat that
    covers the innards,  and he shall take away the two
    kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the
    loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys;
     and the priest shall burn them on the altar for an
    offering made by fire to Yahweh: it is a trespass
    offering.  Every male among the priests may eat of
    it. It shall be eaten in a holy place. It is most holy.
     ' 'As is the sin offering, so is the trespass offering; there is one law for them. The priest who makes
    atonement with them shall have it.  The priest
    who offers any man's burnt offering shall have for
    himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has
    offered.  Every meal offering that is baked in the
    oven, and all that is prepared in the pan and on the
    griddle, shall be the priest's who offers it.  Every
    meal offering, mixed with oil or dry, belongs to all
    the sons of Aaron, one as well as another.
     ' 'This is the law of the sacrifice of peace
    offerings, which one shall offer to Yahweh:  If
    he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer
    with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes
    mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed
    with oil, and cakes mixed with oil.  He shall offer
    his offering with the sacrifice of his peace offerings
    for thanksgiving with cakes of leavened bread.  Of
    it he shall offer one out of each offering for a
    heave offering to Yahweh. It shall be the priest's
    who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings.
     The flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings
    for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his
    offering. He shall not leave any of it until the
    morning.
     ' 'But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow,
    or a free will offering, it shall be eaten on the day
    that he offers his sacrifice. On the next day what
    remains of it shall be eaten,  but what remains of
    the meat of the sacrifice on the third day shall be
    burned with fire.  If any of the meat of the sacrifice
    of his peace offerings is eaten on the third day, it
    will not be accepted, and it shall not be credited to
    him who offersit. It will be an abomination, and the
    soul who eats any of it will bear his iniquity.
     ' 'The meat that touches any unclean thing
    shall not be eaten. It shall be burned with fire.
    As for the meat, everyone who is clean may eat
    it;  but the soul who eats of the meat of the
    sacrifice of peace offerings that belongs to Yahweh,
    having his uncleanness on him, that soul shall be
    cut off from his people.  When anyone touches
    any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an
    unclean animal, or any unclean abomination, and
    eats some of the meat of the sacrifice of peace
    offerings which belong to Yahweh, that soul shall
    be cut off from his people.' '
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to
    the children of Israel, saying, 'You shall eat no fat,
    of bull, or sheep, or goat.  The fat of that which
    dies of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of
    animals, may be used for any other service, but you
    shall in no way eat of it.  For whoever eats the fat
    of the animal which men offer as an offering made
    by fire to Yahweh, even the soul who eats it shall
    be cut off from his people.  You shall not eat any
    blood, whether it is of bird or of animal, in any of
    your dwellings.  Whoever it is who eats any blood,
    that soul shall be cut off from his people.' '
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to
    the children of Israel, saying, 'He who offers the

      
    sacrifice of his peace offerings to Yahweh shall
    bring his offering to Yahweh out of the sacrifice of
    his peace offerings.  With his own hands he shall
    bring the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. He shall
    bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may
    be waved for a wave offering before Yahweh.  The
    priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast
    shall be Aaron's and his sons'. The right thigh you
    shall give to the priest for a heave offering out of
    the sacrifices of your peace offerings.  He among
    the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace
    offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for
    a portion.  For the waved breast and the heaved
    thigh I have taken from the children of Israel out
    of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have
    given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as
    their portion forever from the children of Israel.' '
     This is the consecrated portion of Aaron, and
    the consecrated portion of his sons, out of the
    offerings of Yahweh made by fire, in the day when
    he presented them to minister to Yahweh in the
    priest's office;  which Yahweh commanded to be
    given them of the children of Israel, in the day
    that he anointed them. It is their portion forever
    throughout their generations.  This is the law
    of the burnt offering, the meal offering, the sin
    offering, the trespass offering, the consecration,
    and the sacrifice of peace offerings which Yahweh
    commanded Moses in Mount Sinai in the day that
    he commanded the children of Israel to offer their
    offerings to Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Take Aaron
    and his sons with him, and the garments, and the
    anointing oil, and the bull of the sin offering, and
    the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;
     and assemble all the congregation at the door of
    the Tent of Meeting.'
     Moses did as Yahweh commanded him; and the
    congregation was assembled at the door of the Tent
    of Meeting.  Moses said to the congregation, 'This
    is the thing which Yahweh has commanded to be
    done.'  Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and
    washed them with water. He put the tunic on him,
    tied the sash on him, clothed him with the robe,
    put the ephod on him, and he tied the skillfully
    woven band of the ephod on him and fastened it
    to him with it.  He placed the breastplate on him.
    He put the Urim and Thummim in the breastplate.
     He set the turban on his head. He set the golden
    plate, the holy crown, on the front of the turban,
    as Yahweh commanded Moses.  Moses took the
    anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all
    that was in it, and sanctified them.  He sprinkled
    it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar
    and all its vessels, and the basin and its base, to
    sanctify them.  He poured some of the anointing
    oil on Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify
    him.  Moses brought Aaron's sons, and clothed
    them with tunics, and tied sashes on them, and put
    headbands on them, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
     He brought the bull of the sin offering, and
    Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of
    the bull of the sin offering. He killed it; and Moses
    took the blood, and put it around on the horns of
    the altar with his finger, and purified the altar, and
    poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and
    sanctified it, to make atonement for it.  He took
    all the fat that was on the innards, and the cover
    of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and
    Moses burned it on the altar.  But the bull, and its
    skin, and its meat, and its dung, he burned with fire
    outside the camp, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
    He presented the ram of the burnt offering. Aaron
    and his sons laid their hands on the head of the
    ram.  He killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood
    around on the altar. He cut the ram into its pieces;
    and Moses burned the head, and the pieces, and
    the fat.  He washed the innards and the legs with
    water; and Moses burned the whole ram on the
    altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma. It
    was an offering made by fire to Yahweh, as Yahweh
    commanded Moses.  He presented the other ram,
    the ram of consecration. Aaron and his sons laid
    their hands on the head of the ram.  He killed it;
    and Moses took some of its blood, and put it on the
    tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his
    right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.
     He brought Aaron's sons; and Moses put some
    of the blood on the tip of their right ear, and on
    the thumb of their right hand, and on the great toe
    of their right foot; and Moses sprinkled the blood
    around on the altar.  He took the fat, the fat tail,
    all the fat that was on the innards, the cover of the
    liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right
    thigh;  and out of the basket of unleavened bread
    that was before Yahweh, he took one unleavened
    cake, one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and
    placed them on the fat and on the right thigh.
     He put all these in Aaron's hands and in his sons'
    hands, and waved them for a wave offering before
    Yahweh.  Moses took them from their hands, and
    burned them on the altar on the burnt offering.
    They were a consecration offering for a pleasant
    aroma. It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
     Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave
    offering before Yahweh. It was Moses' portion of
    the ram of consecration, as Yahweh commanded
    Moses.  Moses took some of the anointing oil,
    and some of the blood which was on the altar, and
    sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, and on
    his sons, and on his sons' garments with him, and
    sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his
    sons' garments with him.
     Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, 'Boil
    the meat at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and
    there eat it and the bread that is in the basket
    of consecration, as I commanded, saying, 'Aaron
    and his sons shall eat it.'  What remains of the
    meat and of the bread you shall burn with fire.
     You shall not go out from the door of the Tent
    of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your
    consecration are fulfilled: for he shall consecrate
    you seven days.  What has been done today, so
    Yahweh has commanded to do, to make atonement
    for you.  You shall stay at the door of the Tent
    of Meeting day and night seven days, and keep
      
    Yahweh's command, that you don't die: for so I
    am commanded.'  Aaron and his sons did all the
    things which Yahweh commanded by Moses.
    
     On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his
    sons, and the elders of Israel;  and he said to Aaron,
    'Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and
    a ram for a burnt offering, without defect, and
    offer them before Yahweh.  You shall speak to the
    children of Israel, saying, 'Take a male goat for a
    sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old,
    without defect, for a burnt offering;  and a bull
    and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before
    Yahweh; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for
    today Yahweh appears to you.' '
     They brought what Moses commanded before
    the Tent of Meeting. All the congregation came
    near and stood before Yahweh.  Moses said, 'This
    is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you
    should do; and Yahweh's glory shall appear to you.'
     Moses said to Aaron, 'Draw near to the altar, and
    offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and
    make atonement for yourself, and for the people;
    and offer the offering of the people, and make
    atonement for them, as Yahweh commanded.'
     So Aaron came near to the altar, and killed
    the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
     The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him;
    and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put
    it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the
    blood at the base of the altar;  but the fat, and
    the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the
    sin offering, he burned upon the altar, as Yahweh
    commanded Moses.  The meat and the skin he
    burned with fire outside the camp.  He killed the
    burnt offering; and Aaron's sons delivered the blood
    to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar.
     They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece
    by piece, and the head. He burned them upon the
    altar.  He washed the innards and the legs, and
    burned them on the burnt offering on the altar.
     He presented the people's offering, and took the
    goat of the sin offering which was for the people,
    and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first.
     He presented the burnt offering, and offered it
    according to the ordinance.  He presented the
    meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and
    burned it upon the altar, in addition to the burnt
    offering of the morning.  He also killed the bull
    and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
    was for the people. Aaron's sons delivered to him
    the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar;
     and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat
    tail, and that which covers the innards, and the
    kidneys, and the cover of the liver;  and they put
    the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat
    on the altar.  Aaron waved the breasts and the
    right thigh for a wave offering before Yahweh, as
    Moses commanded.  Aaron lifted up his hands
    toward the people, and blessed them; and he came
    down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt
    offering, and the peace offerings.
     Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and
    Yahweh's glory appeared to all the people.  Fire
    came out from before Yahweh, and consumed the
    burnt offering and the fat upon the altar. When all
    the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their
    faces.
    
     Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took
    his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it,
    and offered strange fire before Yahweh, which he
    had not commanded them.  Fire came out from
    before Yahweh, and devoured them, and they died
    before Yahweh.
    Then Moses said to Aaron, 'This is what Yahweh
    spoke of, saying,
    'I will show myself holy to those who come near me,
    and before all the people I will be glorified.' '
    Aaron held his peace.  Moses called Mishael and
    Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and
    said to them, 'Draw near, carry your brothers from
    before the sanctuary out of the camp.'  So they
    came near, and carried them in their tunics out of
    the camp, as Moses had said.
     Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to
    Ithamar, his sons, 'Don't let the hair of your heads
    go loose, and don't tear your clothes, so that you
    don't die, and so that he will not be angry with all
    the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole
    house of Israel, bewail the burning which Yahweh
    has kindled.  You shall not go out from the door of
    the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the anointing
    oil of Yahweh is on you.' They did according to the
    word of Moses.  Then Yahweh said to Aaron,  'You
    and your sons are not to drink wine or strong drink
    whenever you go into the Tent of Meeting, or you
    will die. This shall be a statute forever throughout
    your generations.  You are to make a distinction
    between the holy and the common, and between
    the unclean and the clean.  You are to teach the
    children of Israel all the statutes which Yahweh has
    spoken to them by Moses.'
     Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to
    Ithamar, his sons who were left, 'Take the meal
    offering that remains of the offerings of Yahweh
    made by fire, and eat it without yeast beside the
    altar; for it is most holy;  and you shall eat it in a
    holy place, because it is your portion, and your sons'
    portion, of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire; for
    so I am commanded.  The waved breast and the
    heaved thigh you shall eat in a clean place, you, and
    your sons, and your daughters with you: for they
    are given as your portion, and your sons' portion,
    out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the
    children of Israel.  They shall bring the heaved
    thigh and the waved breast with the offerings made
    by fire of the fat,to wave it for a wave offering before
    Yahweh. It shall be yours, and your sons' with you,
    as a portion forever, as Yahweh has commanded.'

      
     Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the
    sin offering, and, behold,* it was burned. He was
    angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of
    Aaron who were left, saying,  'Why haven't you
    eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary,
    since it is most holy, and he has given it to you
    to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make
    atonement for them before Yahweh?  Behold, its
    blood was not brought into the inner part of the
    sanctuary. You certainly should have eaten it in the
    sanctuary, as I commanded.'
     Aaron spoke to Moses, 'Behold, today they
    have offered their sin offering and their burnt
    offering before Yahweh; and such things as these
    have happened to me. If I had eaten the sin offering
    today, would it have been pleasing in Yahweh's
    sight?'
     When Moses heard that, it was pleasing in his
    sight.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying
    to them,  'Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'These are the living things which you may
    eat among all the animals that are on the earth.
    Whatever partsthe hoof, and is cloven-footed, and
    chewsthe cud among the animals, that you may eat.
     ' 'Nevertheless these you shall not eat of those
    that chew the cud, or of those who part the hoof:
    the camel, because it chews the cud but doesn't
    have a parted hoof, is unclean to you.  The hyrax,*
    because it chews the cud but doesn't have a parted
    hoof, is unclean to you.  The hare, because it chews
    the cud but doesn't have a parted hoof, is unclean
    to you.  The pig, because it has a split hoof, and is
    cloven-footed, but doesn't chew the cud, is unclean
    to you.  You shall not eat their meat. You shall not
    touch their carcasses. They are unclean to you.
     ' 'You may eat of all these that are in the waters:
    whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the
    seas, and in the rivers, that you may eat.  All that
    don't have fins and scales in the seas and rivers, all
    that move in the waters, and all the living creatures
    that are in the waters, they are an abomination to
    you,  and you shall detest them. You shall not eat
    of their meat, and you shall detest their carcasses.
     Whatever has no fins nor scales in the waters is
    an abomination to you.
     ' 'You shall detest these among the birds; they
    shall not be eaten because they are an abomination:
    the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture,  the red
    kite, any kind of black kite,  any kind of raven,
     the horned owl,the screech owl,the gull, any kind
    of hawk,  the little owl, the cormorant, the great
    owl,  the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey,
     the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the
    bat.
     ' 'All flying insects that walk on all fours are an
    abomination to you.  Yet you may eat these: of all
    winged creeping things that go on all fours, which
    have long, jointed legs for hopping on the earth.
     Even of these you may eat: any kind of locust, any
    kind of katydid, any kind of cricket, and any kind
    of grasshopper.  But all winged creeping things
    which have four feet are an abomination to you.
     ' 'By these you will become unclean: whoever
    touches their carcass shall be unclean until the
    evening.  Whoever carries any part of their
    carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until
    the evening.
     ' 'Every animal which has a split hoof that
    isn't completely divided, or doesn't chew the cud, is
    unclean to you. Everyone who touches them shall
    be unclean.  Whatever goes on its paws, among
    all animals that go on all fours, they are unclean
    to you. Whoever touches their carcass shall be
    unclean until the evening.  He who carries their
    carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until
    the evening. They are unclean to you.
     ' 'These are they which are unclean to you
    among the creeping things that creep on the earth:
    the weasel, the rat, any kind of great lizard,  the
    gecko, and the monitor lizard, the wall lizard, the
    skink, and the chameleon.  These are they which
    are unclean to you among all that creep. Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be
    unclean until the evening.  Anything they fall
    on when they are dead shall be unclean; whether
    it is any vessel of wood, or clothing, or skin, or
    sack, whatever vessel it is, with which any work
    is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be
    unclean until the evening. Then it will be clean.
     Every earthen vessel into which any of them falls
    and all that is in it shall be unclean. You shall
    break it.  All food which may be eaten which is
    soaked in water shall be unclean. All drink that
    may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.
     Everything whereupon part of their carcass falls
    shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots,
    it shall be broken in pieces. They are unclean, and
    shall be unclean to you. Nevertheless a spring or a
    cistern in which water is gathered shall be clean, but
    that which touches their carcass shall be unclean.
     If part of their carcass falls on any sowing seed
    which is to be sown, it is clean.  But if water is put
    on the seed, and part of their carcass falls on it, it is
    unclean to you.
     ' 'If any animal of which you may eat dies, he
    who touches its carcass shall be unclean until the
    evening. He who eats of its carcass shall wash his
    clothes, and be unclean until the evening. He also
    who carries its carcass shall wash his clothes, and
    be unclean until the evening.
     ' 'Every creeping thing that creeps on the earth
    is an abomination. it shall not be eaten. Whatever
    goes on its belly, and whatever goes on all fours, or
    whatever has many feet, even all creeping things
    that creep on the earth, them you shall not eat;
    for they are an abomination.  You shall not make
    yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that
    creeps. You shall not make yourselves unclean
    with them, that you should be defiled by them.
     For I am Yahweh your God. Sanctify yourselves
    therefore, and be holy; for I am holy. You shall not
    defile yourselves with any kind of creeping thing
    that moves on the earth.  For I am Yahweh who

      
    brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your
    God. You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
     ' 'This is the law of the animal, and of the
    bird, and of every living creature that moves in the
    waters, and of every creature that creeps on the
    earth,  to make a distinction between the unclean
    and the clean, and between the living thing that
    may be eaten and the living thing that may not be
    eaten.' '
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to the
    children of Israel, saying, 'If a woman conceives,
    and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean
    seven days; as in the days of her monthly period
    she shall be unclean.  In the eighth day the flesh
    of his foreskin shall be circumcised.  She shall
    continue in the blood of purification thirty-three
    days. She shall not touch any holy thing, nor come
    into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying
    are completed. But if she bears a female child,then
    she shall be unclean two weeks, asin her period; and
    she shall continue in the blood of purification sixty-six days.
     ' 'When the days of her purification are completed for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to
    the priest at the door of the Tent of Meeting, a year
    old lamb for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon
    or a turtledove, for a sin offering.  He shall offer it
    before Yahweh, and make atonement for her; then
    she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood.
    ' 'This is the law for her who bears, whether a
    male or a female.  If she cannot afford a lamb, then
    she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons:
    the one for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin
    offering. The priest shall make atonement for her,
    and she shall be clean.' '
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
     'When a man shall have a swelling in his body's
    skin, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it becomes
    in the skin of his body the plague of leprosy, then
    he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one
    of his sons, the priests.  The priest shall examine
    the plague in the skin of the body. If the hair in
    the plague has turned white, and the appearance of
    the plague is deeper than the body's skin, it is the
    plague of leprosy; so the priest shall examine him
    and pronounce him unclean.  If the bright spot is
    white in the skin of his body, and its appearance
    isn't deeper than the skin, and its hair hasn't turned
    white, then the priest shall isolate the infected
    person for seven days.  The priest shall examine
    him on the seventh day. Behold, if in his eyes the
    plague is arrested and the plague hasn't spread in
    the skin, then the priest shall isolate him for seven
    more days.  The priest shall examine him again on
    the seventh day. Behold, if the plague has faded
    and the plague hasn't spread in the skin, then the
    priest shall pronounce him clean. It is a scab. He
    shall wash his clothes, and be clean.  But if the scab
    spreads on the skin after he has shown himself to
    the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to
    the priest again. The priest shall examine him; and
    behold, if the scab has spread on the skin, then the
    priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is leprosy.
     'When the plague of leprosy isin a man, then he
    shall be brought to the priest;  and the priest shall
    examine him. Behold, if there is a white swelling
    in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and
    there is raw flesh in the swelling,  it is a chronic
    leprosy in the skin of his body, and the priest shall
    pronounce him unclean. He shall not isolate him,
    for he is already unclean.
     'If the leprosy breaks out all over the skin, and
    the leprosy covers all the skin of the infected person
    from his head even to his feet, as far as it appears
    to the priest,  then the priest shall examine him.
    Behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he
    shall pronounce him clean of the plague. It has
    all turned white: he is clean.  But whenever raw
    flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.  The
    priest shall examine the raw flesh, and pronounce
    him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean. It is leprosy.
     Or if the raw flesh turns again, and is changed to
    white, then he shall come to the priest. The priest
    shall examine him. Behold, if the plague has turned
    white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean of
    the plague. He is clean.
     'When the body has a boil on its skin, and it
    has healed,  and in the place of the boil there is
    a white swelling, or a bright spot, reddish-white,
    then it shall be shown to the priest.  The priest
    shall examine it. Behold, if its appearance is deeper
    than the skin, and its hair has turned white, then
    the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is the
    plague of leprosy. It has broken out in the boil.
     But if the priest examines it, and behold, there
    are no white hairs in it, and it isn't deeper than the
    skin, but is dim, then the priest shall isolate him
    seven days.  If it spreads in the skin, then the
    priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a plague.
     But if the bright spot stays in its place, and hasn't
    spread, it is the scar from the boil; and the priest
    shall pronounce him clean.
     'Or when the body has a burn from fire on
    its skin, and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a
    bright spot, reddish-white, or white,  then the
    priest shall examine it; and behold, if the hair in the
    bright spot has turned white, and its appearance is
    deeper than the skin, it is leprosy. It has broken
    out in the burning, and the priest shall pronounce
    him unclean. It is the plague of leprosy.  But
    if the priest examines it, and behold, there is no
    white hair in the bright spot, and it isn't deeper than
    the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall isolate
    him seven days.  The priest shall examine him on
    the seventh day. If it has spread in the skin, then
    the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is the
    plague of leprosy.  If the bright spot stays in its
    place, and hasn't spread in the skin, but is faded, it
    is the swelling from the burn, and the priest shall
    pronounce him clean, for it is the scar from the
    burn.
     'When a man or woman has a plague on
    the head or on the beard,  then the priest shall
    examine the plague; and behold, if its appearance is
    deeper than the skin, and the hair in it is yellow and
      
    thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean.
    It is an itch. It is leprosy of the head or of the beard.
     If the priest examines the plague of itching, and
    behold, its appearance isn't deeper than the skin,
    and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall
    isolate the person infected with itching seven days.
     On the seventh day the priest shall examine the
    plague; and behold, if the itch hasn't spread, and
    there is no yellow hair in it, and the appearance of
    the itch isn't deeper than the skin,  then he shall
    be shaved, but he shall not shave the itch. Then
    the priest shall isolate the one who has the itch
    seven more days.  On the seventh day, the priest
    shall examine the itch; and behold, if the itch hasn't
    spread in the skin, and its appearance isn't deeper
    than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him
    clean. He shall wash his clothes and be clean.  But
    if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing,
     then the priest shall examine him; and behold, if
    the itch has spread in the skin, the priest shall not
    look for the yellow hair; he is unclean. But if in his
    eyes the itch is arrested and black hair has grown in
    it, then the itch is healed. He is clean. The priest
    shall pronounce him clean.
     'When a man or a woman has bright spots in
    the skin of the body, even white bright spots,  then
    the priest shall examine them. Behold, if the bright
    spots on the skin of their body are a dull white, it is
    a harmless rash. It has broken out in the skin. He is
    clean.
     'If a man's hair has fallen from his head, he is
    bald. He is clean.  If his hair has fallen off from
    the front part of his head, he is forehead bald. He is
    clean.  But if a reddish-white plague is in the bald
    head or the bald forehead, it is leprosy breaking out
    in his bald head or his bald forehead.  Then the
    priest shall examine him. Behold, if the swelling
    of the plague is reddish-white in his bald head, or
    in his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy
    in the skin of the body,  he is a leprous man. He
    is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him
    unclean. His plague is on his head.
     'The leper in whom the plague is shall wear
    torn clothes, and the hair of his head shall hang
    loose. He shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry,
    'Unclean! Unclean!'  All the days in which the
    plague is in him he shall be unclean. He is unclean.
    He shall dwell alone. His dwelling shall be outside
    of the camp.
     'The garment also that the plague of leprosy
    is in, whether it is a woolen garment, or a linen
    garment;  whether it is in warp or woof;* of linen
    or of wool; whether in a leather, or in anything
    made of leather;  if the plague is greenish or
    reddish in the garment, or in the leather, or in the
    warp, orin the woof, orin anything made of leather;
    it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be shown to the
    priest.  The priest shall examine the plague, and
    isolate the plague seven days.  He shall examine
    the plague on the seventh day. If the plague has
    spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the
    woof, or in the skin, whatever use the skin is used
    for, the plague is a destructive mildew. It is unclean.
     He shall burn the garment, whether the warp or
    the woof, in wool orin linen, or anything of leather,
    in which the plague is, for it is a destructive mildew.
    It shall be burned in the fire.
     'If the priest examines it, and behold, the
    plague hasn't spread in the garment, either in the
    warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin;  then
    the priest shall command that they wash the thing
    that the plague is in, and he shall isolate it seven
    more days.  Then the priest shall examine it, after
    the plague is washed; and behold, if the plague
    hasn't changed its color, and the plague hasn't
    spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire. It
    is a mildewed spot, whether the bareness is inside
    or outside.  If the priest looks, and behold, the
    plague has faded after it is washed, then he shall
    tear it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out
    of the warp, or out of the woof;  and if it appears
    again in the garment, either in the warp, or in the
    woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading. You
    shall burn what the plague is in with fire.  The
    garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatever
    thing of skin it is, which you shall wash, if the plague
    has departed from them, then it shall be washed the
    second time, and it will be clean.'
     This is the law of the plague of mildew in a
    garment of wool or linen, either in the warp, or the
    woof, or in anything of skin, to pronounce it clean,
    or to pronounce it unclean.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
     'This shall be the law of the leper in the day of
    his cleansing: He shall be brought to the priest,  and
    the priest shall go out of the camp. The priest shall
    examine him. Behold, if the plague of leprosy is
    healed in the leper,  then the priest shall command
    them to take for him who is to be cleansed two living
    clean birds, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop.  The
    priest shall command them to kill one of the birds
    in an earthen vessel over running water.  As for
    the living bird, he shall take it, the cedar wood, the
    scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the
    living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed
    over the running water.  He shall sprinkle on him
    who is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times,
    and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the
    living bird go into the open field.
     'He who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes,
    and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water;
    and he shall be clean. After that he shall come
    into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven
    days.  It shall be on the seventh day, that he shall
    shave all his hair off his head and his beard and
    his eyebrows. He shall shave off all his hair. He
    shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his body
    in water. Then he shall be clean.
     'On the eighth day he shall take two male lambs
    without defect, one ewe lamb a year old without

      
    defect, three tenths of an ephah* of fine flour for
    a meal offering, mixed with oil, and one log of
    oil.  The priest who cleanses him shall set the
    man who is to be cleansed, and those things, before
    Yahweh, at the door of the Tent of Meeting.
     'The priest shall take one of the male lambs,
    and offer him for a trespass offering, with the log
    of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before
    Yahweh.  He shall kill the male lamb in the
    place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt
    offering, in the place of the sanctuary; for as the sin
    offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering.
    It is most holy.  The priest shall take some of the
    blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall
    put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be
    cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and
    on the big toe of his right foot.  The priest shall
    take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm
    of his own left hand.  The priest shall dip his right
    finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall
    sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times
    before Yahweh.  The priest shall put some of the
    rest of the oil that is in his hand on the tip of the
    right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the
    thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his
    right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering.
     The rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he
    shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed,
    and the priest shall make atonement for him before
    Yahweh.
     'The priest shall offer the sin offering, and
    make atonement for him who is to be cleansed
    because of his uncleanness. Afterward he shall kill
    the burnt offering;  then the priest shall offer the
    burnt offering and the meal offering on the altar.
    The priest shall make atonement for him, and he
    shall be clean.
     'If he is poor, and can't afford so much, then he
    shall take one male lamb for a trespass offering to be
    waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth
    of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal
    offering, and a log of oil;  and two turtledoves, or
    two young pigeons, such as he is able to afford; and
    the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt
    offering.
     'On the eighth day he shall bring them for his
    cleansing to the priest, to the door of the Tent of
    Meeting, before Yahweh. The priest shall take the
    lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and
    the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before
    Yahweh.  He shall kill the lamb of the trespass
    offering. The priest shall take some of the blood
    of the trespass offering and put it on the tip of the
    right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the
    thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his
    right foot.  The priest shall pour some of the oil
    into the palm of his own left hand;  and the priest
    shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil
    that is in his left hand seven times before Yahweh.
     Then the priest shall put some of the oil that is
    in his hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is
    to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand,
    and on the big toe of his right foot, on the place
    of the blood of the trespass offering.  The rest
    of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put
    on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make
    atonement for him before Yahweh. He shall offer
    one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons,
    which ever he is able to afford,  of the kind he is
    able to afford, the one for a sin offering, and the
    other for a burnt offering, with the meal offering.
    The priest shall make atonement for him who is to
    be cleansed before Yahweh.'
     This is the law for him in whom is the plague
    of leprosy, who is not able to afford the sacrifice for
    his cleansing.
     Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
     'When you have come into the land of Canaan,
    which I give to you for a possession, and I put a
    spreading mildew in a house in the land of your
    possession,  then he who owns the house shall
    come and tell the priest, saying, 'There seems to me
    to be some sort of plague in the house.' The priest
    shall command that they empty the house, before
    the priest goes in to examine the plague, that all
    that isin the house not be made unclean. Afterward
    the priest shall go in to inspect the house. He shall
    examine the plague; and behold, if the plague is in
    the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish
    or reddish, and it appears to be deeper than the
    wall,  then the priest shall go out of the house
    to the door of the house, and shut up the house
    seven days.  The priest shall come again on the
    seventh day, and look. If the plague has spread
    in the walls of the house,  then the priest shall
    command that they take out the stones in which
    is the plague, and cast them into an unclean place
    outside of the city.  He shall cause the inside of
    the house to be scraped all over. They shall pour
    out the mortar that they scraped off outside of the
    city into an unclean place.  They shall take other
    stones, and put them in the place of those stones;
    and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the
    house.
     'If the plague comes again, and breaks out in
    the house after he has taken out the stones, and
    after he has scraped the house, and after it was
    plastered,  then the priest shall come in and look;
    and behold, if the plague has spread in the house, it
    is a destructive mildew in the house. It is unclean.
     He shall break down the house, its stones, and its
    timber, and all the house's mortar. He shall carry
    them out of the city into an unclean place.
     'Moreover he who goes into the house while it
    is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.  He
    who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes;
    and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
     'If the priest shall come in, and examine it,
    and behold, the plague hasn't spread in the house,
    after the house was plastered, then the priest shall
    pronounce the house clean, because the plague
    is healed.  To cleanse the house he shall take
    two birds, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop.  He
    shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over

      
    running water.  He shall take the cedar wood,
    the hyssop, the scarlet, and the living bird, and
    dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the
    running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.
     He shall cleanse the house with the blood of the
    bird, and with the running water, with the living
    bird, with the cedar wood, with the hyssop, and
    with the scarlet;  but he shall let the living bird go
    out of the city into the open field. So shall he make
    atonement for the house; and it shall be clean.'
     This is the law for any plague of leprosy, and
    for an itch,  and for the destructive mildew of a
    garment, and for a house,  and for a swelling, and
    for a scab, and for a bright spot;  to teach when it
    is unclean, and when it is clean.
    This is the law of leprosy.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
     'Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them,
    'When any man has a discharge from his body,
    because of his discharge he is unclean.  This
    shall be his uncleanness in his discharge: whether
    his body runs with his discharge, or his body has
    stopped from his discharge, it is his uncleanness.
     ' 'Every bed on which he who has the discharge
    lies shall be unclean; and everything he sits on
    shall be unclean.  Whoever touches his bed shall
    wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
    unclean until the evening. He who sits on anything
    on which the man who has the discharge sat shall
    wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
    be unclean until the evening.
     ' 'He who touches the body of him who has the
    discharge shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself
    in water, and be unclean until the evening.
     ' 'If he who has the discharge spits on him who
    is clean, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe
    himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
     ' 'Whatever saddle he who has the discharge
    rides on shall be unclean.  Whoever touches
    anything that was under him shall be unclean until
    the evening. He who carries those things shall
    wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
    be unclean until the evening.
     ' 'Whomever he who has the discharge
    touches, without having rinsed his hands in water,
    he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in
    water, and be unclean until the evening.
     ' 'The earthen vessel, which he who has the
    discharge touches,shall be broken; and every vessel
    of wood shall be rinsed in water.
     ' 'When he who has a discharge is cleansed of
    his discharge, then he shall count to himself seven
    days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he
    shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be
    clean.
     ' 'On the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and come before
    Yahweh to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and give
    them to the priest.  The priest shall offer them,
    the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt
    offering. The priest shall make atonement for him
    before Yahweh for his discharge.
     ' 'If any man has an emission of semen, then
    he shall bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean
    until the evening.  Every garment and every skin
    which the semen is on shall be washed with water,
    and be unclean until the evening.  If a man lies
    with a woman and there is an emission of semen,
    they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be
    unclean until the evening.
     ' 'If a woman has a discharge, and her discharge
    in her flesh is blood, she shall be in her impurity
    seven days. Whoever touches her shall be unclean
    until the evening.
     ' 'Everything that she lies on in her impurity
    shall be unclean. Everything also that she sits on
    shall be unclean.  Whoever touches her bed shall
    wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
    be unclean until the evening.  Whoever touches
    anything that she sits on shall wash his clothes, and
    bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the
    evening.  If it is on the bed, or on anything she sits
    on, when he touches it, he shall be unclean until the
    evening.
     ' 'If any man lies with her, and her monthly
    flow is on him, he shall be unclean seven days; and
    every bed he lies on shall be unclean.
     ' 'If a woman has a discharge of her blood many
    days not in the time of her period, or if she has
    a discharge beyond the time of her period, all the
    days of the discharge of her uncleanness shall be as
    in the days of her period. She is unclean.  Every
    bed she lies on all the days of her discharge shall
    be to her as the bed of her period. Everything
    she sits on shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of
    her period.  Whoever touches these things shall
    be unclean, and shall wash his clothes and bathe
    himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
     ' 'But if she is cleansed of her discharge, then
    she shall count to herself seven days, and after that
    she shall be clean.  On the eighth day she shall
    take two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and
    bring them to the priest, to the door of the Tent of
    Meeting.  The priest shall offer the one for a sin
    offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the
    priest shall make atonement for her before Yahweh
    for the uncleanness of her discharge.
     ' 'Thus you shall separate the children of Israel
    from their uncleanness, so they will not die in their
    uncleanness when they defile my tabernacle that is
    among them.' '
     This is the law of him who has a discharge, and
    of him who has an emission of semen, so that he is
    unclean by it;  and of her who has her period, and
    of a man or woman who has a discharge, and of him
    who lies with her who is unclean.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses after the death of the
    two sons of Aaron, when they came near before
    Yahweh, and died;  and Yahweh said to Moses, 'Tell
    Aaron your brother not to come at just any time
    into the Most Holy Place within the veil, before the
    mercy seat which is on the ark; lest he die; for I will
    appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.
      
     'Aaron shall come into the sanctuary with a
    young bull for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt
    offering.  He shall put on the holy linen tunic. He
    shall have the linen trousers on his body, and shall
    put on the linen sash, and he shall be clothed with
    the linen turban. They are the holy garments. He
    shall bathe his body in water, and put them on. He
    shall take from the congregation of the children of
    Israel two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram
    for a burnt offering.
     'Aaron shall offer the bull of the sin offering,
    which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house. He shall take the two goats,
    and set them before Yahweh at the door of the
    Tent of Meeting.  Aaron shall cast lots for the two
    goats: one lot for Yahweh, and the other lot for
    the scapegoat.  Aaron shall present the goat on
    which the lot fell for Yahweh, and offer him for a sin
    offering.  But the goat on which the lot fell for the
    scapegoat shall be presented alive before Yahweh,
    to make atonement for him, to send him away as
    the scapegoat into the wilderness.
     'Aaron shall present the bull of the sin offering,
    which is for himself, and shall make atonement for
    himself and for his house, and shall kill the bull of
    the sin offering which is for himself. He shall take
    a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before
    Yahweh, and two handfuls of sweet incense beaten
    small, and bring it within the veil. He shall put the
    incense on the fire before Yahweh, that the cloud of
    the incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the
    covenant, so that he will not die.  He shall take
    some of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it with
    his finger on the mercy seat on the east; and before
    the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood
    with his finger seven times.
     'Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering
    that is for the people, and bring his blood within the
    veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood
    of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat and
    before the mercy seat.  He shall make atonement
    for theHoly Place, because of the uncleanness of the
    children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins; and so he shall do for the
    Tent of Meeting that dwells with them in the middle
    of their uncleanness.  No one shall be in the Tent
    of Meeting when he enters to make atonement in
    the Holy Place, until he comes out, and has made
    atonement for himself and for his household, and
    for all the assembly of Israel.
     'He shall go out to the altar that is before
    Yahweh and make atonement for it, and shall take
    some of the bull's blood, and some of the goat's
    blood, and put it around on the horns of the altar.
     He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his
    finger seven times, and cleanse it, and make it holy
    from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
     'When he has finished atoning for the Holy
    Place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall
    present the live goat.  Aaron shall lay both his
    hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over
    him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and
    all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he
    shall put them on the head of the goat, and shall
    send him away into the wilderness by the hand of a
    man who is ready.  The goat shall carry all their
    iniquities on himself to a solitary land, and he shall
    release the goat in the wilderness.
     'Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and
    shall take off the linen garments which he put on
    when he went into the Holy Place, and shall leave
    them there.  Then he shall bathe himself in water
    in a holy place, put on his garments, and come out
    and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering
    of the people, and make atonement for himself and
    for the people.  The fat of the sin offering he shall
    burn on the altar.
     'He who lets the goat go as the scapegoat shall
    wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and
    afterward he shall come into the camp.  The bull
    for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering,
    whose blood was brought in to make atonement in
    the Holy Place, shall be carried outside the camp;
    and they shall burn their skins, their flesh, and their
    dung with fire. He who burns them shall wash his
    clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward
    he shall come into the camp.
     'It shall be a statute to you forever: in the
    seventh month, on the tenth day of the month,
    you shall afflict your souls, and shall do no kind of
    work, whether native-born or a stranger who lives
    as a foreigner among you;  for on this day shall
    atonement be made for you, to cleanse you. You
    shall be clean from all your sins before Yahweh.  It
    is a Sabbath of solemn rest to you, and you shall
    afflict your souls. It is a statute forever.  The
    priest, who is anointed and who is consecrated
    to be priest in his father's place, shall make the
    atonement, and shall put on the linen garments,
    even the holy garments.  Then he shall make
    atonement for the Holy Sanctuary; and he shall
    make atonement for the Tent of Meeting and for the
    altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests
    and for all the people of the assembly.
     'This shall be an everlasting statute for you, to
    make atonement for the children of Israel once in
    the year because of all their sins.'
    It was done as Yahweh commanded Moses.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to
    Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of
    Israel, and say to them, 'This is the thing which
    Yahweh has commanded:  Whatever man there
    is of the house of Israel who kills a bull, or lamb,
    or goat in the camp, or who kills it outside the
    camp,  and hasn't brought it to the door of the
    Tent of Meeting to offer it as an offering to Yahweh
    before Yahweh's tabernacle: blood shall be imputed
    to that man. He has shed blood. That man shall
    be cut off from among his people.  This is to
    the end that the children of Israel may bring their
    sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field,
    that they may bring them to Yahweh, to the door
    of the Tent of Meeting, to the priest, and sacrifice
    them for sacrifices of peace offerings to Yahweh.
     The priest shall sprinkle the blood on Yahweh's
    altar at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and burn
      
    the fat for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.  They
    shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat
    idols, after which they play the prostitute. This
    shall be a statute forever to them throughout their
    generations.'
     'You shall say to them, 'Any man there is of
    the house of Israel, or of the strangers who live as
    foreigners among them, who offers a burnt offering
    or sacrifice,  and doesn't bring it to the door of the
    Tent of Meeting to sacrifice it to Yahweh, that man
    shall be cut off from his people.
     ' 'Any man of the house of Israel, or of the
    strangers who live as foreigners among them, who
    eats any kind of blood, I will set my face against
    that soul who eats blood, and will cut him off from
    among his people.  for the life of the flesh isin the
    blood. I have given it to you on the altar to make
    atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that
    makes atonement by reason of the life.  Therefore
    I have said to the children of Israel, 'No person
    among you may eat blood, nor may any stranger
    who lives as a foreigner among you eat blood.'
     ' 'Whatever man there is of the children of
    Israel, or of the strangers who live as foreigners
    among them, who takes in hunting any animal or
    bird that may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood,
    and cover it with dust.  For as to the life of all
    flesh, its blood is with its life. Therefore I said to
    the children of Israel, 'You shall not eat the blood of
    any kind of flesh; for the life of all flesh is its blood.
    Whoever eats it shall be cut off.'
     ' 'Every person that eats what dies of itself,
    or that which is torn by animals, whether he is
    native-born or a foreigner, shall wash his clothes,
    and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the
    evening. Then he shall be clean.  But if he doesn't
    wash them, or bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his
    iniquity.' '
    
     Yahweh said to Moses,  'Speak to the children
    of Israel, and say to them, 'I am Yahweh your God.
     You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt,
    where you lived. You shall not do as they do in
    the land of Canaan, where I am bringing you. You
    shall not follow their statutes.  You shall do my
    ordinances. You shall keep my statutes and walk in
    them. I am Yahweh your God.  You shall therefore
    keep my statutes and my ordinances, which if a man
    does, he shall live in them. I am Yahweh.
     ' 'None of you shall approach any close relatives, to uncover their nakedness: I am Yahweh.
     ' 'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your
    father, nor the nakedness of your mother: she is
    your mother. You shall not uncover her nakedness.
     ' 'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your
    father's wife. It is your father's nakedness.
     ' 'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your
    sister, the daughter of your father, or the daughter
    of your mother, whether born at home or born
    abroad.
     ' 'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your
    son's daughter, or of your daughter's daughter,
    even their nakedness; for theirs is your own nakedness.
     ' 'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your
    father's wife's daughter, conceived by your father,
    since she is your sister.
     ' 'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your
    father's sister. She is your father's near kinswoman.
     ' 'You shall not uncover the nakedness of
    your mother's sister, for she is your mother's near
    kinswoman.
     ' 'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your
    father's brother. You shall not approach his wife.
    She is your aunt.
     ' 'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your
    daughter-in-law. She is your son's wife. You shall
    not uncover her nakedness.
     ' 'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your
    brother's wife. It is your brother's nakedness.
     ' 'You shall not uncover the nakedness of a
    woman and her daughter. You shall not take her
    son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness. They are near kinswomen. It
    is wickedness.
     ' 'You shall not take a wife in addition to her
    sister, to be a rival, to uncover her nakedness, while
    her sister is still alive.
     ' 'You shall not approach a woman to uncover
    her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her
    uncleanness.
     ' 'You shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife, and defile yourself with her.
     ' 'You shall not give any of your children as a
    sacrifice to Molech. You shall not profane the name
    of your God. I am Yahweh.
     ' 'You shall not lie with a man as with a woman.
    That is detestable.
     ' 'You shall not lie with any animal to defile
    yourself with it. No woman may give herself to an
    animal, to lie down with it: it is a perversion.
     ' 'Don't defile yourselves in any of these things;
    for in all these the nations which I am casting out
    before you were defiled.  The land was defiled.
    Therefore I punished its iniquity, and the land
    vomited out her inhabitants.  You therefore shall
    keep my statutes and my ordinances, and shall not
    do any of these abominations; neither the native born, nor the stranger who lives as a foreigner
    among you  (for the men of the land that were
    before you had done all these abominations, and the
    land became defiled),  that the land not vomit you
    out also, when you defile it, as it vomited out the
    nation that was before you.
     ' 'For whoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off
    from among their people.  Therefore you shall
    keep my requirements, that you do not practice any
    of these abominable customs which were practiced
    before you, and that you do not defile yourselves
    with them. I am Yahweh your God.' '
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to all
    the congregation of the children of Israel, and tell
      
    them, 'You shall be holy; for I, Yahweh your God,
    am holy.
     ' 'Each one of you shall respect his mother and
    his father. You shall keep my Sabbaths. I am
    Yahweh your God.
     ' 'Don't turn to idols, nor make molten gods for
    yourselves. I am Yahweh your God.
     ' 'When you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings
    to Yahweh, you shall offer it so that you may be
    accepted.  It shall be eaten the same day you offer
    it, and on the next day. If anything remains until
    the third day, it shall be burned with fire.  If it is
    eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination.
    It will not be accepted;  but everyone who eats it
    shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the
    holy thing of Yahweh, and that soul shall be cut off
    from his people.
     ' 'When you reap the harvest of your land, you
    shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.

    your people.

    is a slave girl, pledged to be married to another
    man, and not ransomed or given her freedom; they
    shall be punished. They shall not be put to death,
    because she was not free.  He shall bring his
    trespass offering to Yahweh, to the door of the Tent
    of Meeting, even a ram for a trespass offering. The
    priest shall make atonement for him with the ram
    of the trespass offering before Yahweh for his sin
    which he has committed; and the sin which he has
    committed shall be forgiven him.

    for giving praise to Yahweh.  In the fifth year you
    shall eat its fruit, that it may yield its increase to
    you. I am Yahweh your God.

     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Moreover,
    you shall tell the children of Israel, 'Anyone of the
    children of Israel, or of the strangers who live as
    foreigners in Israel, who gives any of his offspring*
    to Molech shall surely be put to death. The people of
    the land shall stone that person with stones.  I also
    will set my face against that person, and will cut him
    off from among his people, because he has given of
    his offspring to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and
    to profane my holy name.  If the people of the land
    all hide their eyes from that person when he gives of
    his offspring to Molech, and don't put him to death,

      
     then I will set my face against that man and against
    his family, and will cut him off, and all who play
    the prostitute after him to play the prostitute with
    Molech, from among their people.
     ' 'The person that turns to those who are mediums and wizards,
    to play the prostitute after them,
    I will even set my face against that person, and will
    cut him off from among his people.
     ' 'Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be holy; for
    I am Yahweh your God. You shall keep my statutes,
    and do them. I am Yahweh who sanctifies you.
     ' 'For everyone who curses his father or his
    mother shall surely be put to death. He has cursed
    his father or his mother. His blood shall be upon
    himself.
     ' 'The man who commits adultery with another
    man's wife, even he who commits adultery with his
    neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress
    shall surely be put to death.
     ' 'The man who lies with his father's wife has
    uncovered his father's nakedness. Both of them
    shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be
    upon themselves.
     ' 'If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both
    of them shall surely be put to death. They have
    committed a perversion. Their blood shall be upon
    themselves.
     ' 'If a man lies with a male, as with a woman,
    both of them have committed an abomination.
    They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall
    be upon themselves.
     ' 'If a man takes a wife and her mother, it is
    wickedness. They shall be burned with fire, both he
    and they, that there may be no wickedness among
    you.
     ' 'If a man lies with an animal, he shall surely
    be put to death; and you shall kill the animal.
     ' 'If a woman approaches any animal and lies
    with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal.
    They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall
    be upon them.
     ' 'If a man takes his sister-his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter-and sees her nakedness,
    and she sees his nakedness, it is a shameful
    thing. They shall be cut off in the sight of the
    children of their people. He has uncovered his
    sister's nakedness. He shall bear his iniquity.
     ' 'If a man lies with a woman having her
    monthly period, and uncovers her nakedness, he
    has made her fountain naked, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood. Both of them shall
    be cut off from among their people.
     ' 'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your
    mother's sister, nor of your father's sister, for he
    has made his close relative naked. They shall bear
    their iniquity.  If a man lies with his uncle's wife,
    he has uncovered his uncle's nakedness. They shall
    bear their sin. They shall die childless.
     ' 'If a man takes his brother's wife, it is an impurity. He has uncovered his brother's nakedness.
    They shall be childless.
     ' 'You shall therefore keep all my statutes and
    all my ordinances, and do them, that the land where
    I am bringing you to dwell may not vomit you out.
     You shall not walk in the customs of the nation
    which I am casting out before you; for they did all
    these things, and therefore I abhorred them.  But
    I have said to you, 'You shall inherit their land, and
    I will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with
    milk and honey.' I am Yahweh your God, who has
    separated you from the peoples.
     ' 'You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean,
    and between the unclean fowl and the clean. You shall not
    make yourselves abominable by animal, or by bird,
    or by anything with which the ground teems, which
    I have separated from you as unclean for you. You
    shall be holy to me, forI, Yahweh, am holy, and have
    set you apart from the peoples, that you should be
    mine.
     ' 'A man or a woman that is a medium or is
    a wizard shall surely be put to death. They shall
    be stoned with stones. Their blood shall be upon
    themselves.' '
    
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Speak to the priests,
    the sons of Aaron, and say to them, 'A priest shall
    not defile himself for the dead among his people,
     except for his relatives that are near to him: for his
    mother, for his father, for his son, for his daughter,
    for his brother,  and for his virgin sister who is near
    to him, who has had no husband; for her he may
    defile himself.  He shall not defile himself, being a
    chief man among his people, to profane himself.
     ' 'They shall not shave their heads or shave off
    the corners of their beards or make any cuttings in
    their flesh.  They shall be holy to their God, and
    not profane the name of their God, for they offer
    the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, the bread of
    their God. Therefore they shall be holy.
     ' 'They shall not marry a woman who is a
    prostitute, or profane. A priest shall not marry a
    woman divorced from her husband; for he is holy
    to his God.  Therefore you shall sanctify him, for
    he offers the bread of your God. He shall be holy to
    you, for I Yahweh, who sanctify you, am holy.
     ' 'The daughter of any priest, if she profanes
    herself by playing the prostitute, she profanes her
    father. She shall be burned with fire.
     ' 'He who is the high priest among his brothers,
    upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and
    who is consecrated to put on the garments, shall
    not let the hair of his head hang loose, or tear his
    clothes.  He must not go in to any dead body, or
    defile himself for his father or for his mother.  He
    shall not go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the
    sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing
    oil of his God is upon him. I am Yahweh.
     ' 'He shall take a wife in her virginity.  He
    shall not marry a widow, or one divorced, or a
    woman who has been defiled, or a prostitute. He
    shall take a virgin of his own people as a wife.  He
    shall not profane his offspring among his people, for
    I am Yahweh who sanctifies him.' '
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Say to
    Aaron, 'None of your offspring throughout their
    generations who has a defect may approach to offer
      
    the bread of his God.  For whatever man he is that
    has a defect, he shall not draw near: a blind man, or
    a lame, or he who has a flat nose, or any deformity,
     or a man who has an injured foot, or an injured
    hand,  or hunchbacked, or a dwarf, or one who has
    a defect in his eye, or an itching disease, or scabs,
    or who has damaged testicles.  No man of the
    offspring of Aaron the priest who has a defect shall
    come near to offer the offerings of Yahweh made by
    fire. Since he has a defect, he shall not come near to
    offer the bread of his God.  He shall eat the bread
    of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.
    He shall not come near to the veil, nor come near
    to the altar, because he has a defect; that he may
    not profane my sanctuaries, for I am Yahweh who
    sanctifies them.' '
     So Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his sons, and
    to all the children of Israel.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Tell Aaron
    and his sons to separate themselves from the holy
    things of the children of Israel, which they make
    holy to me, and that they not profane my holy
    name. I am Yahweh.
     'Tell them, 'If anyone of all your offspring
    throughout your generations approaches the holy
    things which the children of Israel make holy to
    Yahweh, having his uncleanness on him, that soul
    shall be cut off from before me. I am Yahweh.
     ' 'Whoever of the offspring of Aaron is a leper
    or has a discharge shall not eat of the holy things
    until he is clean. Whoever touches anything that is
    unclean by the dead, or a man who has a seminal
    emission,  or whoever touches any creeping thing
    by which he may be made unclean, or a man from
    whom he may become unclean, whatever uncleanness he has-  the person that touches any such
    shall be unclean until the evening, and shall not
    eat of the holy things unless he bathes his body
    in water.  When the sun is down, he shall be
    clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things,
    because it is his bread. He shall not eat that which
    dies of itself or is torn by animals, defiling himself
    by it. I am Yahweh.
     ' 'They shall therefore follow my commandment, lest they bear sin for it and die in it, if they
    profane it. I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.
     ' 'No stranger shall eat of the holy thing: a
    foreigner living with the priests, or a hired servant,
    shall not eat of the holy thing.  But if a priest
    buys a slave, purchased by his money, he shall eat
    of it; and those who are born in his house shall eat
    of his bread.  If a priest's daughter is married to
    an outsider, she shall not eat of the heave offering
    of the holy things.  But if a priest's daughter is
    a widow, or divorced, and has no child, and has
    returned to her father's house as in her youth, she
    may eat of her father's bread; but no stranger shall
    eat any of it.
     ' 'If a man eats something holy unwittingly,
    then he shall add the fifth part of its value to it, and
    shall give the holy thing to the priest.  The priests
    shall not profane the holy things of the children of
    Israel, which they offer to Yahweh,  and so cause
    them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt when
    they eat their holy things; for I am Yahweh who
    sanctifies them.' '
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to
    Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of
    Israel, and say to them, 'Whoever is of the house
    of Israel, or of the foreigners in Israel, who offers
    his offering, whether it is any of their vows or
    any of their free will offerings, which they offer to
    Yahweh for a burnt offering:  that you may be
    accepted, you shall offer a male without defect, of
    the bulls, of the sheep, or of the goats.  But you
    shall not offer whatever has a defect, for it shall not
    be acceptable for you.  Whoever offers a sacrifice
    of peace offerings to Yahweh to accomplish a vow,
    or for a free will offering of the herd or of the flock,
    it shall be perfect to be accepted. It shall have
    no defect.  You shall not offer what is blind, is
    injured, is maimed, has a wart, is festering, or has
    a running sore to Yahweh, nor make an offering by
    fire of them on the altar to Yahweh.  Either a bull
    or a lamb that has any deformity or lacking in his
    parts, that you may offer for a free will offering; but
    for a vow it shall not be accepted.  You must not
    offer to Yahweh that which has its testicles bruised,
    crushed, broken, or cut. You must not do this in
    your land.  You must not offer any of these as
    the bread of your God from the hand of a foreigner,
    because their corruption is in them. There is a
    defect in them. They shall not be accepted for
    you.' '
    Yahweh spoke to Moses,saying,  'When a bull,
    a sheep, or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days
    with its mother. From the eighth day on it shall be
    accepted for the offering of an offering made by fire
    to Yahweh.  Whether it is a cow or ewe, you shall
    not kill it and its young both in one day.
     'When you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving
    to Yahweh, you shall sacrifice it so that you may
    be accepted.  It shall be eaten on the same day;
    you shall leave none of it until the morning. I am
    Yahweh.
     'Therefore you shall keep my commandments,
    and do them. I am Yahweh.  You shall not profane
    my holy name, but I will be made holy among the
    children of Israel. I am Yahweh who makes you holy,
     who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be
    your God. I am Yahweh.'
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to the
    children of Israel, and tell them, 'The set feasts
    of Yahweh, which you shall proclaim to be holy
    convocations, even these are my set feasts.
     ' 'Six days shall work be done, but on the
    seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy
    convocation; you shall do no kind of work. It is a
    Sabbath to Yahweh in all your dwellings.
     ' 'These are the set feasts of Yahweh, even holy
    convocations, which you shall proclaim in their
    appointed season.  In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, is Yahweh's
    Passover.  On the fifteenth day of the same month
      
    is the feast of unleavened bread to Yahweh. Seven
    days you shall eat unleavened bread.  In the first
    day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do
    no regular work.  But you shall offer an offering
    made by fire to Yahweh seven days. In the seventh
    day is a holy convocation. You shall do no regular
    work.' '
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to the
    children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you have
    come into the land which I give to you, and shall
    reap its harvest, then you shall bring the sheaf of
    the first fruits of your harvest to the priest.  He
    shall wave the sheaf before Yahweh, to be accepted
    for you. On the next day after the Sabbath the priest
    shall wave it. On the day when you wave the sheaf,
    you shall offer a male lamb without defect a year
    old for a burnt offering to Yahweh.  The meal
    offering with it shall be two tenths of an ephah* of
    fine flour mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to
    Yahweh for a pleasant aroma; and the drink offering
    with it shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.
     You must not eat bread, or roasted grain, or fresh
    grain, until this same day, until you have brought
    the offering of your God. This is a statute forever
    throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
     ' 'You shall count from the next day after
    the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the
    sheaf of the wave offering: seven Sabbaths shall
    be completed.  The next day after the seventh
    Sabbath you shall count fifty days; and you shall
    offer a new meal offering to Yahweh.  You shall
    bring out of your habitations two loaves of bread for
    a wave offering made of two tenths of an ephah of
    fine flour. They shall be baked with yeast, for first
    fruits to Yahweh. You shall present with the bread
    seven lambs without defect a year old, one young
    bull, and two rams. They shall be a burnt offering
    to Yahweh, with their meal offering and their drink
    offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet
    aroma to Yahweh.  You shall offer one male goat
    for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old
    for a sacrifice of peace offerings.  The priest shall
    wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a
    wave offering before Yahweh, with the two lambs.
    They shall be holy to Yahweh for the priest.  You
    shall make proclamation on the same day that there
    shall be a holy convocation to you. You shall do no
    regular work. This is a statute forever in all your
    dwellings throughout your generations.
     ' 'When you reap the harvest of your land,
    you must not wholly reap into the corners of your
    field. You must not gather the gleanings of your
    harvest. You must leave them for the poor and for
    the foreigner. I am Yahweh your God.' '
    Yahweh spoke to Moses,saying,  'Speak to the
    children of Israel, saying, 'In the seventh month, on
    the first day of the month, there shall be a solemn
    rest for you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets,
    a holy convocation.  You shall do no regular
    work. You shall offer an offering made by fire to
    Yahweh.' '
    Yahweh spoke to Moses,saying,  'However on
    the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of
    atonement. It shall be a holy convocation to you.
    You shall afflict yourselves and you shall offer an
    offering made by fire to Yahweh.  You shall do
    no kind of work in that same day, for it is a day
    of atonement, to make atonement for you before
    Yahweh your God.  For whoever it is who shall not
    deny himself in that same day shall be cut off from
    his people. Whoever does any kind of work in that
    same day, I will destroy that person from among
    his people.  You shall do no kind of work: it is a
    statute forever throughout your generations in all
    your dwellings.  It shall be a Sabbath of solemn
    rest for you, and you shall deny yourselves. In the
    ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to
    evening, you shall keep your Sabbath.'
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to
    the children of Israel, and say, 'On the fifteenth day
    of this seventh month is the feast of booths for
    seven days to Yahweh.  On the first day shall be
    a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work.
     Seven days you shall offer an offering made by
    fire to Yahweh. On the eighth day shall be a holy
    convocation to you. You shall offer an offering
    made by fire to Yahweh. It is a solemn assembly;
    you shall do no regular work.
     ' 'These are the appointed feasts of Yahweh
    which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations,
    to offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh, a burnt
    offering, a meal offering, a sacrifice, and drink
    offerings, each on its own day-  in addition to the
    Sabbaths of Yahweh, and in addition to your gifts,
    and in addition to all your vows, and in addition
    to all your free will offerings, which you give to
    Yahweh.
     ' 'So on the fifteenth day of the seventh month,
    when you have gathered in the fruits of the land,
    you shall keep the feast of Yahweh seven days. On
    the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the
    eighth day shall be a solemn rest.  You shall take
    on the first day the fruit of majestic trees, branches
    of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows
    of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh
    your God seven days.  You shall keep it as a feast
    to Yahweh seven days in the year. It is a statute
    forever throughout your generations. You shall
    keep it in the seventh month.  You shall dwell
    in temporary shelters* for seven days. All who
    are native-born in Israel shall dwell in temporary
    shelters,  that your generations may know that
    I made the children of Israel to dwell in temporary
    shelters when I brought them out of the land of
    Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.' '
     So Moses declared to the children of Israel the
    appointed feasts of Yahweh.

      
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Command
    the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure
    olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp
    to burn continually.  Outside of the veil of the
    Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron shall keep
    it in order from evening to morning before Yahweh
    continually. It shall be a statute forever throughout
    your generations.  He shall keep in order the
    lamps on the pure gold lamp stand before Yahweh
    continually.
     'You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes
    of it: two tenths of an ephah* shall be in one cake.
     You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on
    the pure gold table before Yahweh.  You shall put
    pure frankincense on each row, that it may be to
    the bread for a memorial, even an offering made
    by fire to Yahweh.  Every Sabbath day he shall
    set it in order before Yahweh continually. It is an
    everlasting covenant on the behalf of the children
    of Israel.  It shall be for Aaron and his sons. They
    shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy to
    him of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire by a
    perpetual statute.'
     The son of an Israelite woman, whose father
    was an Egyptian, went out among the children of
    Israel; and the son of the Israelite woman and a
    man of Israel strove together in the camp.  The
    son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name,
    and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. His
    mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of
    Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.  They put him in
    custody until Yahweh's will should be declared to
    them.  Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Bring
    him who cursed out of the camp; and let all who
    heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all
    the congregation stone him.  You shall speak
    to the children of Israel, saying, 'Whoever curses
    his God shall bear his sin.  He who blasphemes
    Yahweh's name, he shall surely be put to death. All
    the congregation shall certainly stone him. The
    foreigner as well as the native-born shall be put to
    death when he blasphemes the Name.
     ' 'He who strikes any man mortally shall surely
    be put to death.  He who strikes an animal
    mortally shall make it good, life for life.  If anyone
    injures his neighbor, it shall be done to him as he
    has done:  fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth
    for tooth. It shall be done to him as he has injured
    someone.  He who kills an animal shall make it
    good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death.
     You shall have one kind of law for the foreigner
    as well as the native-born; for I am Yahweh your
    God.' '
     Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they
    brought him who had cursed out of the camp, and
    stoned him with stones. The children of Israel did
    as Yahweh commanded Moses.
    
     Yahweh said to Moses on Mount Sinai,  'Speak
    to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you
    come into the land which I give you, then the land
    shall keep a Sabbath to Yahweh. You shall sow your
    field six years, and you shall prune your vineyard six
    years, and gather in its fruits;  but in the seventh
    year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for the
    land, a Sabbath to Yahweh. You shall not sow your
    field or prune your vineyard.  What grows of itself
    in your harvest you shall not reap, and you shall not
    gather the grapes of your undressed vine. it shall be
    a year of solemn rest for the land.  The Sabbath of
    the land shall be for food for you; for yourself, for
    your servant, for your maid, for your hired servant,
    and for your stranger, who lives as a foreigner with
    you.  For your livestock also, and for the animals
    that are in your land, shall all its increase be for
    food.
     ' 'You shall count off seven Sabbaths of years,
    seven times seven years; and there shall be to you
    the days of seven Sabbaths of years, even forty-nine
    years.  Then you shall sound the loud trumpet
    on the tenth day of the seventh month. On the
    Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet
    throughout all your land.  You shall make the
    fiftieth year holy, and proclaim liberty throughout
    the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee
    to you; and each of you shall return to his own
    property, and each of you shall return to his family.
     That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you. In it
    you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of
    itself, nor gather from the undressed vines.  For it
    is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat of
    its increase out of the field.
     ' 'In this Year of Jubilee each of you shall return
    to his property.
     ' 'If you sell anything to your neighbor, or
    buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong one
    another.  According to the number of years
    after the Jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor.
    According to the number of years of the crops he
    shall sell to you.  According to the length of the
    years you shall increase its price, and according to
    the shortness of the years you shall diminish its
    price; for he is selling the number of the crops to
    you.  You shall not wrong one another, but you
    shall fear your God; for I am Yahweh your God.
     ' 'Therefore you shall do my statutes, and keep
    my ordinances and do them; and you shall dwell
    in the land in safety.  The land shall yield its
    fruit, and you shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in
    safety.  If you said, 'What shall we eat the seventh
    year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our
    increase;'  then I will command my blessing on
    you in the sixth year, and it shall bear fruit for the
    three years.  You shall sow the eighth year, and
    eat of the fruits from the old store until the ninth
    year. Until its fruits come in, you shall eat the old
    store.
     ' 'The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for
    the land is mine; for you are strangers and live
    as foreigners with me.  In all the land of your
    possession you shall grant a redemption for the
    land.
     ' 'If your brother becomes poor, and sells some
    of his possessions, then his kinsman who is next to

      
    him shall come, and redeem that which his brother
    has sold.  If a man has no one to redeem it, and he
    becomes prosperous and finds sufficient means to
    redeem it,  then let him reckon the years since its
    sale, and restore the surplus to the man to whom
    he sold it; and he shall return to his property.
     But if he isn't able to get it back for himself, then
    what he has sold shall remain in the hand of him
    who has bought it until the Year of Jubilee. In the
    Jubilee it shall be released, and he shall return to
    his property.
     ' 'If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled
    city, then he may redeem it within a whole year
    after it has been sold. For a full year he shall have
    the right of redemption.  If it isn't redeemed
    within the space of a full year, then the house that is
    in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to
    him who bought it, throughout his generations. It
    shall not be released in the Jubilee. But the houses
    of the villages which have no wall around them shall
    be accounted for with the fields of the country: they
    may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the
    Jubilee.
     ' 'Nevertheless, in the cities of the Levites,
    the Levites may redeem the houses in the cities of
    their possession at any time.  The Levites may
    redeem the house that was sold, and the city of his
    possession, and it shall be released in the Jubilee;
    for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their
    possession among the children of Israel.  But the
    field of the pasture lands of their cities may not be
    sold, for it is their perpetual possession.
     ' 'If your brother has become poor, and his
    hand can't support himself among you, then you
    shall uphold him. He shall live with you like an alien
    and a temporary resident.  Take no interest from
    him or profit; but fear your God, that your brother
    may live among you.  You shall not lend him your
    money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.
     I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of
    the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan,
    and to be your God.
     ' 'If your brother has grown poor among you,
    and sells himself to you, you shall not make him
    to serve as a slave.  As a hired servant, and as a
    temporary resident, he shall be with you; he shall
    serve with you until the Year of Jubilee.  Then
    he shall go out from you, he and his children with
    him, and shall return to his own family, and to
    the possession of his fathers.  For they are my
    servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt.
    They shall not be sold as slaves. You shall not rule
    over him with harshness, but shall fear your God.
     ' 'As for your male and your female slaves,
    whom you may have from the nations that are
    around you, from them you may buy male and
    female slaves.  Moreover, of the children of the
    aliens who live among you, of them you may buy,
    and of their families who are with you, which they
    have conceived in your land; and they will be your
    property.  You may make them an inheritance for
    your children after you, to hold for a possession.
    Of them you may take your slaves forever, but over
    your brothers the children of Israel you shall not
    rule, one over another, with harshness.
     ' 'If an alien or temporary resident with you
    becomes rich, and your brother beside him has
    grown poor, and sells himself to the stranger or
    foreigner living among you, or to a member of
    the stranger's family,  after he is sold he may be
    redeemed. One of his brothers may redeem him;
     or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him,
    or any who is a close relative to him of his family
    may redeem him; or if he has grown rich, he may
    redeem himself.  He shall reckon with him who
    bought him from the year that he sold himself to
    him to the Year of Jubilee. The price of his sale shall
    be according to the number of years; he shall be
    with him according to the time of a hired servant.
     If there are yet many years, according to them he
    shall give back the price of his redemption out of
    the money that he was bought for.  If there remain
    but a few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall
    reckon with him; according to his years of service
    he shall give back the price of his redemption.  As
    a servant hired year by year shall he be with him.
    He shall not rule with harshness over him in your
    sight.  If he isn't redeemed by these means, then
    he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee: he and his
    children with him.  For to me the children of Israel
    are servants; they are my servants whom I brought
    out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.
    
     ' 'You shall make for yourselves no idols, and
    you shall not raise up a carved image or a pillar, and
    you shall not place any figured stone in your land,
    to bow down to it; for I am Yahweh your God.
     ' 'You shall keep my Sabbaths, and have reverence for my sanctuary. I am Yahweh.
     ' 'If you walk in my statutes and keep my
    commandments, and do them,  then I will give you
    your rains in their season, and the land shall yield
    its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield
    their fruit.  Your threshing shall continue until
    the vintage, and the vintage shall continue until the
    sowing time. You shall eat your bread to the full,
    and dwell in your land safely.
     ' 'I will give peace in the land, and you shall
    lie down, and no one will make you afraid. I will
    remove evil animals out of the land, neither shall
    the sword go through your land.  You shall chase
    your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the
    sword.  Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a
    hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your
    enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
     ' 'I will have respect for you, make you fruitful,
    multiply you, and will establish my covenant with
    you.  You shall eat old supplies long kept, and you
    shall move out the old because of the new.  I will
    set my tent among you, and my soul won't abhor
    you.  I will walk among you, and will be your God,
    and you will be my people.  I am Yahweh your God,
    who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you
    should not be their slaves. I have broken the bars of
    your yoke, and made you walk upright.
      
     ' 'But if you will not listen to me, and will not do
    all these commandments,  and if you shall reject
    my statutes, and if your soul abhors my ordinances,
    so that you will not do all my commandments, but
    break my covenant,  I also will do this to you: I
    will appoint terror over you, even consumption and
    fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the
    soul to pine away. You will sow your seed in vain, for
    your enemies will eat it.  I will set my face against
    you, and you will be struck before your enemies.
    Those who hate you will rule over you; and you will
    flee when no one pursues you.
     ' 'If you in spite of these things will not listen
    to me, then I will chastise you seven times more for
    your sins.  I will break the pride of your power,
    and I will make your sky like iron, and your soil like
    bronze.  Your strength will be spent in vain; for
    your land won't yield its increase, neither will the
    trees of the land yield their fruit.
     ' 'If you walk contrary to me, and won't listen
    to me, then I will bring seven times more plagues
    on you according to your sins.  I will send the
    wild animals among you, which will rob you of your
    children, destroy your livestock, and make you few
    in number. Your roads will become desolate.
     ' 'If by these things you won't be turned back
    to me, but will walk contrary to me,  then I will
    also walk contrary to you; and I will strike you,
    even I, seven times for your sins.  I will bring a
    sword upon you that will execute the vengeance of
    the covenant. You will be gathered together within
    your cities, and I will send the pestilence among
    you. You will be delivered into the hand of the
    enemy.  When I break your staff of bread, ten
    women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they
    shall deliver your bread again by weight. You shall
    eat, and not be satisfied.
     ' 'If you in spite of this won't listen to me, but
    walk contrary to me,  then I will walk contrary to
    you in wrath. I will also chastise you seven times
    for your sins.  You will eat the flesh of your sons,
    and you will eat the flesh of your daughters.  I
    will destroy your high places, and cut down your
    incense altars, and cast your dead bodies upon the
    bodies of your idols; and my soul will abhor you.
     I will lay your cities waste, and will bring your
    sanctuaries to desolation. I will not take delight
    in the sweet fragrance of your offerings.  I will
    bring the land into desolation, and your enemies
    who dwell in it will be as tonished at it.  I will
    scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out
    the sword after you. Your land will be a desolation,
    and your cities shall be a waste.  Then the land
    will enjoy its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and
    you are in your enemies' land. Even then the land
    will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.  As long as it lies
    desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it
    didn't have in your Sabbaths when you lived on it.
     ' 'As for those of you who are left, I will send
    a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their
    enemies. The sound of a driven leaf will put them
    to flight; and they shall flee, as one flees from the
    sword. They will fall when no one pursues.  They
    will stumble over one another, as it were before
    the sword, when no one pursues. You will have no
    power to stand before your enemies.  You will
    perish among the nations. The land of your enemies
    will eat you up. Those of you who are left will pine
    away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and
    also in the iniquities of their fathers they shall pine
    away with them.
     ' 'If they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they
    trespassed against me; and also that because they
    walked contrary to me,  I also walked contrary
    to them, and brought them into the land of their
    enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their
    iniquity,  then I will remember my covenant
    with Jacob, my covenant with Isaac, and also my
    covenant with Abraham; and I will remember the
    land.  The land also will be left by them, and
    will enjoy its Sabbaths while it lies desolate without
    them; and they will accept the punishment of their
    iniquity because they rejected my ordinances, and
    their soul abhorred my statutes.  Yet for all that,
    when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not
    reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy
    them utterly and to break my covenant with them;
    forI am Yahweh their God.  But I  will for their sake
    remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I
    brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the
    nations, that I might be their God. I am Yahweh.' '
     These are the statutes, ordinances, and laws,
    which Yahweh made between him and the children
    of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to the
    children of Israel, and say to them, 'When a man
    consecrates a person to Yahweh in a vow, according
    to your valuation,  your valuation of a male from
    twenty years old to sixty years old shall be fifty
    shekels of silver, according to the shekel* of the
    sanctuary.  If she is a female, then your valuation
    shall be thirty shekels.  If the person is from five
    years old to twenty years old, then your valuation
    shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female
    ten shekels.  If the person is from a month old
    to five years old, then your valuation shall be for
    a male five shekels of silver, and for a female your
    valuation shall be three shekels of silver.  If the
    person is from sixty years old and upward; if he is
    a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels,
    and for a female ten shekels.  But if he is poorer
    than your valuation, then he shall be set before
    the priest, and the priest shall assign a value to
    him. The priest shall assign a value according to his
    ability to pay.
     ' 'If it is an animal of which men offer an
    offering to Yahweh, all that any man gives of such
    to Yahweh becomes holy. He shall not alter it, nor
    exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good.
    If he shall at all exchange animal for animal, then
    both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be
    holy.  If it is any unclean animal, of which they do

      
    not offer as an offering to Yahweh, then he shall set
    the animal before the priest;  and the priest shall
    evaluate it, whether it is good or bad. As the priest
    evaluates it, so it shall be.  But if he will indeed
    redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to its
    valuation.
     ' 'When a man dedicates his house to be holy to
    Yahweh, then the priest shall evaluate it, whether
    it is good or bad. As the priest evaluates it, so it
    shall stand.  If he who dedicates it will redeem his
    house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money
    of your valuation to it, and it shall be his.
     ' 'If a man dedicates to Yahweh part of the
    field of his possession, then your valuation shall be
    according to the seed for it. The sowing of a homer
    of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
     If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee,
    according to your valuation it shall stand.  But
    if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the
    priest shall reckon to him the money according to
    the years that remain to the Year of Jubilee; and an
    abatement shall be made from your valuation.  If
    he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it,
    then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your
    valuation to it, and it shall remain his.  If he will
    not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to
    another man, it shall not be redeemed any more;
     but the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall
    be holy to Yahweh, as a devoted field. It shall be
    owned by the priests.
     ' 'If he dedicates a field to Yahweh which he has
    bought, which is not of the field of his possession,
     then the priest shall reckon to him the worth
    of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee; and
    he shall give your valuation on that day, as a holy
    thing to Yahweh.  In the Year of Jubilee the
    field shall return to him from whom it was bought,
    even to him to whom the possession of the land
    belongs.  All your valuations shall be according to
    the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs to the
    shekel.*
     ' 'However the firstborn among animals, which
    belongs to Yahweh as a firstborn, no man may
    dedicate, whether an ox or a sheep. It is Yahweh's.
     If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back
    according to your valuation, and shall add to it the
    fifth part of it; or if it isn't redeemed, then it shall
    be sold according to your valuation.
     ' 'Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a
    man devotes to Yahweh of all that he has, whether
    of man or animal, or of the field of his possession,
    shall be sold or redeemed. Everything that is
    permanently devoted is most holy to Yahweh.
     ' 'No one devoted to destruction, who shall be
    devoted from among men, shall be ransomed. He
    shall surely be put to death.
     ' 'All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed
    of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is Yahweh's. It
    is holy to Yahweh.  If a man redeems anything of
    his tithe, he shall add a fifth part to it. All the tithe
    of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes under
    the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Yahweh.  He
    shall not examine whether it is good or bad, neither
    shall he exchange it. If he exchanges it at all, then
    both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be
    holy. It shall not be redeemed.' '
     These are the commandments which Yahweh
    commanded Moses for the children of Israel on
    Mount Sinai.

    The Fourth Book of Moses,
    Commonly Called
    Numbers:

     Yahweh* spoke to Moses in the wilderness of
    Sinai, in the Tent of Meeting, on the first day of
    the second month, in the second year after they
    had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,  'Take
    a census of all the congregation of the children of
    Israel, by their families, by their fathers' houses,
    according to the number of the names, every male,
    one by one,  from twenty years old and upward, all
    who are able to go out to war in Israel. You and
    Aaron shall count them by their divisions.  With
    you there shall be a man of every tribe, each one
    head of his fathers' house.  These are the names of
    the men who shall stand with you:
    Of Reuben: Elizur the son of Shedeur.
     Of Simeon: Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
     Of Judah: Nahshon the son of Amminadab.
     Of Issachar: Nethanel the son of Zuar.
     Of Zebulun: Eliab the son of Helon.
    of the children of Joseph: of Ephraim: Elishama
    the son of Ammihud; of Manasseh: Gamaliel the son
    of Pedahzur.
     Of Benjamin: Abidan the son of Gideoni.
     Of Dan: Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
     Of Asher: Pagiel the son of Ochran.
     Of Gad: Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
     Of Naphtali: Ahira the son of Enan.'
     These are those who were called of the congregation, the princes of the tribes of their fathers;
    they were the heads of the thousands of
    Israel.  Moses and Aaron took these men who
    are mentioned by name.  They assembled all the
    congregation together on the first day of the second
    month; and they declared their ancestry by their
    families, by their fathers' houses, according to the
    number of the names, from twenty years old and
    upward, one by one.  As Yahweh commanded
    Moses, so he counted them in the wilderness of
    Sinai.
     The children of Reuben, Israel's firstborn, their
    generations, by their families, by their fathers'
    houses, according to the number of the names,
    one by one, every male from twenty years old and
    upward, all who were able to go out to war:  those
    who were counted of them, of the tribe of Reuben,
    were forty-six thousand five hundred.
    of the children of Simeon, their generations, by
    their families, by their fathers' houses, those who
    were counted of it, according to the number of the
    names, one by one, every male from twenty years
    old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
     those who were counted of them, of the tribe of
    Simeon, were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.
     Of the children of Gad, their generations, by
    their families, by their fathers' houses, according to
    the number of the names, from twenty years old and
    upward, all who were able to go out to war:  those
    who were counted of them, of the tribe of Gad, were
    forty-five thousand six hundred fifty.
     Of the children of Judah, their generations, by
    their families, by their fathers' houses, according to
    the number of the names, from twenty years old and
    upward, all who were able to go out to war:  those
    who were counted of them, of the tribe of Judah,
    were seventy-four thousand six hundred.
     Of the children of Issachar, their generations,
    by their families, by their fathers' houses, according
    to the number of the names, from twenty years old
    and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
     those who were counted of them, of the tribe of
    Issachar, were fifty-four thousand four hundred.
     Of the children of Zebulun, their generations,
    by their families, by their fathers' houses, according
    to the number of the names, from twenty years old
    and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
     those who were counted of them, of the tribe of
    Zebulun, were fifty-seven thousand four hundred.
     Of the children of Joseph: of the children of
    Ephraim, their generations, by their families, by
    their fathers' houses, according to the number of
    the names, from twenty years old and upward, all
    who were able to go out to war:  those who were
    counted of them, of the tribe of Ephraim, were forty
    thousand five hundred.
    Of the children of Manasseh, their generations,
    by their families, by their fathers' houses, according
    to the number of the names, from twenty years old
    and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
     those who were counted of them, of the tribe of
    Manasseh, were thirty-two thousand two hundred.
     Of the children of Benjamin, their generations,
    by their families, by their fathers' houses, according
    to the number of the names, from twenty years old
    and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
     those who were counted of them, of the tribe of
    Benjamin, were thirty-five thousand four hundred.
     Of the children of Dan, their generations, by
    their families, by their fathers' houses, according to
    the number of the names, from twenty years old and
    upward, all who were able to go out to war:  those
    who were counted of them, of the tribe of Dan, were
    sixty-two thousand seven hundred.
     Of the children of Asher, their generations, by
    their families, by their fathers' houses, according to
    the number of the names, from twenty years old and
    upward, all who were able to go out to war:  those
    who were counted of them, of the tribe of Asher,
    were forty-one thousand five hundred.
     Of the children of Naphtali, their generations,
    by their families, by their fathers' houses, according
    to the number of the names, from twenty years old
    and upward, all who were able to go out to war:
     those who were counted of them, of the tribe of
    Naphtali, were fifty-three thousand four hundred.
     These are those who were counted, whom
    Moses and Aaron counted, and the twelve men who
    were princes of Israel, each one for his fathers'
    house.  So all those who were counted of the children
    of Israel by their fathers' houses, from twenty

      
    years old and upward, all who were able to go out
    to war in Israel -  all those who were counted
    were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.
    But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were
    not counted among them.  For Yahweh spoke to
    Moses, saying,  'Only the tribe of Levi you shall
    not count, neither shall you take a census of them
    among the children of Israel;  but appoint the
    Levites over the Tabernacle of the Testimony, and
    over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs
    to it. They shall carry the tabernacle and all its
    furnishings; and they shall take care of it, and shall
    encamp around it.  When the tabernacle is to
    move, the Levites shall take it down; and when the
    tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall set it up.
    The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
     The children of Israel shall pitch their tents,
    every man by his own camp, and every man by his
    own standard, according to their divisions.  But
    the Levites shall encamp around the Tabernacle
    of the Testimony, that there may be no wrath on
    the congregation of the children of Israel. The
    Levites shall be responsible for the Tabernacle of
    the Testimony.'
     Thus the children of Israel did. According to all
    that Yahweh commanded Moses, so they did.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
     'The children of Israel shall encamp every man by
    his own standard, with the banners of their fathers'
    houses. They shall encamp around the Tent of
    Meeting at a distance from it.
     'Those who encamp on the east side toward
    the sunrise shall be of the standard of the camp of
    Judah, according to their divisions. The prince of
    the children of Judah shall be Nahshon the son of
    Amminadab.  His division, and those who were
    counted of them, were seventy-four thousand six
    hundred.
     'Those who encamp next to him shall be the
    tribe of Issachar. The prince of the children of
    Issachar shall be Nethanel the son of Zuar.  His
    division, and those who were counted of it, were
    fifty-four thousand four hundred.
     'The tribe of Zebulun: the prince of the children
    of Zebulun shall be Eliab the son of Helon.  His
    division, and those who were counted of it, were
    fifty-seven thousand four hundred.
     'All who were counted of the camp of Judah
    were one hundred eighty-six thousand four hundred, according to their divisions. They shallset out
    first.
     'On the south side shall be the standard of the
    camp of Reuben according to their divisions. The
    prince of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the
    son of Shedeur.  His division, and those who were
    counted of it, were forty-six thousand five hundred.
     'Those who encamp next to him shall be the
    tribe of Simeon. The prince of the children of
    Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.
    His division, and those who were counted of them,
    were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.
     'The tribe of Gad: the prince of the children
    of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.  His
    division, and those who were counted of them, were
    forty-five thousand six hundred fifty.
     'All who were counted of the camp of Reuben
    were one hundred fifty-one thousand four hundred
    fifty, according to their armies. They shall set out
    second.
     'Then the Tent of Meeting shall set out, with
    the camp of the Levites in the middle of the camps.
    As they encamp, so shall they set out, every man in
    his place, by their standards.
     'On the west side shall be the standard of the
    camp of Ephraim according to their divisions. The
    prince of the children of Ephraim shall be Elishama
    the son of Ammihud.  His division, and those
    who were counted of them, were forty thousand five
    hundred.
     'Next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh.
    The prince of the children of Manasseh shall be
    Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.  His division, and
    those who were counted of them, were thirty-two
    thousand two hundred.
     'The tribe of Benjamin: the prince of the
    children of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of
    Gideoni.  His army, and those who were counted
    of them, were thirty-five thousand four hundred.
     'All who were counted of the camp of Ephraim
    were one hundred eight thousand one hundred,
    according to their divisions. They shall set out
    third.
     'On the north side shall be the standard of
    the camp of Dan according to their divisions. The
    prince of the children of Dan shall be Ahiezer the
    son of Ammishaddai. His division, and those who
    were counted of them, were sixty-two thousand
    seven hundred.
     'Those who encamp next to him shall be the
    tribe of Asher. The prince of the children of Asher
    shall be Pagiel the son of Ochran.  His division,
    and those who were counted of them, were fortyone thousand five hundred.
     'The tribe of Naphtali: the prince of the children of Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.
    His division, and those who were counted of them,
    were fifty-three thousand four hundred.
     'All who were counted of the camp of Dan
    were one hundred fifty-seven thousand six hundred. They shall set out last by their standards.'
     These are those who were counted of the children of Israel by their fathers' houses. All who were
    counted of the camps according to their armies
    were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.
     But the Levites were not counted among the
    children of Israel, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
     Thus the children of Israel did. According to all
    that Yahweh commanded Moses, so they encamped
    by their standards, and so they set out, everyone by
    their families, according to their fathers' houses.
    
     Now this is the history of the generations of
    Aaron and Mosesin the day that Yahweh spoke with
    Moses in Mount Sinai.  These are the names of
      
    the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu,
    Eleazar, and Ithamar.
     These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the
    priests who were anointed, whom he consecrated
    to minister in the priest's office. Nadab and Abihu
    died before Yahweh when they offered strange fire
    before Yahweh in the wilderness of Sinai, and they
    had no children. Eleazar and Ithamar ministered
    in the priest's office in the presence of Aaron their
    father.
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Bring the
    tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the
    priest, that they may minister to him.  They shall
    keep hisrequirements, and the requirements of the
    whole congregation before the Tent of Meeting,
    to do the service of the tabernacle.  They shall
    keep all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting, and
    the obligations of the children of Israel, to do the
    service of the tabernacle. You shall give the Levites
    to Aaron and to his sons. They are wholly given to
    him on the behalf of the children of Israel.  You
    shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall
    keep their priesthood, but the stranger who comes
    near shall be put to death.'
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Behold,*
    I have taken the Levites from among the children
    of Israel instead of all the firstborn who open the
    womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites
    shall be mine,  for all the firstborn are mine. On
    the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the
    land of Egypt I made holy to me all the firstborn in
    Israel, both man and animal. They shall be mine. I
    am Yahweh.'
     Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of
    Sinai, saying,  'Count the children of Levi by their
    fathers' houses, by their families. You shall count
    every male from a month old and upward.'
     Moses counted them according to Yahweh's
    word, as he was commanded.
     These were the sons of Levi by their names:
    Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
     These are the names of the sons of Gershon by
    their families: Libni and Shimei.
     The sons of Kohath by their families: Amram,
    Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
     The sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and
    Mushi.
    These are the families of the Levites according to
    their fathers' houses.
     Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and
    the family of the Shimeites. These are the families
    of the Gershonites.
     Those who were counted of them, according to
    the number of all the males from a month old and
    upward, even those who were counted of them were
    seven thousand five hundred.
     The families of the Gershonites shall encamp
    behind the tabernacle westward.
     Eliasaph the son of Lael shall be the prince of
    the fathers' house of the Gershonites.  The duty of
    the sons of Gershon in the Tent of Meeting shall be
    the tabernacle, the tent, its covering, the screen for
    the door of the Tent of Meeting,  the hangings of
    the court, the screen for the door of the court which
    is by the tabernacle and around the altar, and its
    cords for all of its service.
    Of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, the
    family of the Izharites, the family of the Hebronites,
    and the family of the Uzzielites. These are the
    families of the Kohathites.  According to the
    number of all the males from a month old and
    upward, there were eight thousand six hundred
    keeping the requirements of the sanctuary.
    The families of the sons of Kohath shall encamp
    on the south side of the tabernacle.  The prince of
    the fathers' house of the families of the Kohathites
    shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.  Their duty
    shall be the ark, the table, the lamp stand, the
    altars, the vessels of the sanctuary with which they
    minister, the screen, and all its service.  Eleazar
    the son of Aaron the priest shall be prince of the
    princes of the Levites, with the oversight of those
    who keep the requirements of the sanctuary.
     Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites and
    the family of the Mushites. These are the families
    of Merari.  Those who were counted of them,
    according to the number of all the males from
    a month old and upward, were six thousand two
    hundred.
     The prince of the fathers' house of the families
    of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. They shall
    encamp on the north side of the tabernacle.  The
    appointed duty of the sons of Merari shall be the
    tabernacle's boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,
    all its instruments, all its service,  the pillars of the
    court around it, their sockets, their pins, and their
    cords.
     Those who encamp before the tabernacle eastward, in front of the Tent of Meeting toward the
    sunrise, shall be Moses, with Aaron and his sons,
    keeping the requirements of the sanctuary for the
    duty of the children of Israel. The outsider who
    comes near shall be put to death.  All who were
    counted of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron
    counted at the commandment of Yahweh, by their
    families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty-two thousand.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Count all the firstborn
    males of the children of Israel from a month old
    and upward, and take the number of their names.
     You shall take the Levites for me-I am Yahweh
    -instead of all the firstborn among the children of
    Israel; and the livestock of the Levites instead of all
    the firstborn among the livestock of the children of
    Israel.'
    Moses counted, as Yahweh commanded him, all
    the firstborn among the children of Israel. All the
    firstborn males according to the number of names
    from a month old and upward, of those who were

      
    counted of them, were twenty-two thousand two
    hundred seventy-three.
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Take the
    Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites
    instead of their livestock; and the Levites shall be
    mine. I am Yahweh.  For the redemption of
    the two hundred seventy-three of the firstborn of
    the children of Israel who exceed the number of
    the Levites,  you shall take five shekels apiece for
    each one; according to the shekel of the sanctuary
    you shall take them (the shekel is twenty gerahs);
     and you shall give the money, with which their
    remainder is redeemed, to Aaron and to his sons.'
     Moses took the redemption money from those
    who exceeded the number of those who were redeemed by the Levites;  from the firstborn of the
    children of Israel he took the money, one thousand
    three hundred sixty-five shekels,* according to the
    shekel of the sanctuary;  and Moses gave the
    redemption money to Aaron and to his sons, according to Yahweh's word, as Yahweh commanded
    Moses.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
     'Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among
    the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers'
    houses,  from thirty years old and upward even
    until fifty years old, all who enter into the service
    to do the work in the Tent of Meeting.
     'This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the
    Tent of Meeting, regarding the most holy things.
     When the camp moves forward, Aaron shall go in
    with his sons; and they shall take down the veil of
    the screen, cover the ark of the Testimony with it,
     put a covering of sealskin on it, spread a blue cloth
    over it, and put in its poles.
     'On the table of show bread they shall spread a
    blue cloth, and put on it the dishes, the spoons, the
    bowls, and the cups with which to pour out; and the
    continual bread shall be on it.  They shall spread
    on them a scarlet cloth, and cover it with a covering
    of sealskin, and shall put in its poles.
     'They shall take a blue cloth and cover the
    lamp stand of the light, its lamps, its snuffers, its
    snuff dishes, and all its oil vessels, with which they
    minister to it.  They shall put it and all its vessels
    within a covering of sealskin, and shall put it on the
    frame.
     'On the golden altar they shall spread a blue
    cloth, and cover it with a covering of sealskin, and
    shall put in its poles.
     'They shall take all the vessels of ministry
    with which they minister in the sanctuary, and put
    them in a blue cloth, cover them with a covering of
    sealskin, and shall put them on the frame.
     'They shall take away the ashes from the altar,
    and spread a purple cloth on it.  They shall put on
    it all its vessels with which they minister about it,
    the fire pans, the meat hooks, the shovels, and the
    basins-all the vessels of the altar; and they shall
    spread on it a covering of sealskin, and put in its
    poles.
     'When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furniture of the
    sanctuary, as the camp moves forward; after that,
    the sons of Kohath shall come to carry it; but they
    shall not touch the sanctuary, lest they die. The
    sons of Kohath shall carry these things belonging
    to the Tent of Meeting.
     'The duty of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
    shall be the oil for the light, the sweet incense, the
    continual meal offering, and the anointing oil, the
    requirements of all the tabernacle, and of all that is
    in it, the sanctuary, and its furnishings.'
     Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
     'Don't cut off the tribe of the families of the
    Kohathites from among the Levites;  but do this
    to them, that they may live, and not die, when they
    approach the most holy things: Aaron and his sons
    shall go in and appoint everyone to his service and
    to his burden;  but they shall not go in to see the
    sanctuary even for a moment, lest they die.'
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Take a
    census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers'
    houses, by their families;  you shall count them
    from thirty years old and upward until fifty years
    old: all who enter in to wait on the service, to do
    the work in the Tent of Meeting.
     'This is the service of the families of the
    Gershonites, in serving and in bearing burdens:
     they shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle
    and the Tent of Meeting, its covering, the covering
    of sealskin that is on it, the screen for the door of
    the Tent of Meeting,  the hangings of the court,
    the screen for the door of the gate of the court
    which is by the tabernacle and around the altar,
    their cords, and all the instruments of theirservice,
    and whatever shall be done with them. They shall
    serve in there.  At the commandment of Aaron
    and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of
    the Gershonites, in all their burden and in all their
    service; and you shall appoint their duty to them in
    all their responsibilities.  This is the service of the
    families of the sons of the Gershonites in the Tent
    of Meeting. Their duty shall be under the hand of
    Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
     'as for the sons of Merari, you shall count them
    by their families, by their fathers' houses;  you
    shall count them from thirty years old and upward
    even to fifty years old -everyone who enters on
    the service, to do the work of the Tent of Meeting.  This is the duty of their burden, according
    to all their service in the Tent of Meeting: the
    tabernacle's boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,
     the pillars of the court around it, their sockets,
    their pins, their cords, with all their instruments,
    and with all their service. You shall appoint the
    instruments of the duty of their burden to them by
    name.  This is the service of the families of the
    sons of Merari, according to all their service in the

      
    Tent of Meeting, under the hand of Ithamar the son
    of Aaron the priest.'
     Moses and Aaron and the princes of the congregation counted the sons of the Kohathites by
    their families, and by their fathers' houses,  from
    thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old,
    everyone who entered into the service for work in
    the Tent of Meeting.  Those who were counted
    of them by their families were two thousand seven
    hundred fifty.  These are those who were counted
    of the families of the Kohathites, all who served
    in the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses and Aaron
    counted according to the commandment of Yahweh
    by Moses.
     Those who were counted of the sons of Gershon, by their families, and by their fathers' houses,
     from thirty years old and upward even to fifty
    years old-everyone who entered into the service
    for work in the Tent of Meeting,  even those who
    were counted of them, by their families, by their
    fathers' houses, were two thousand six hundred
    thirty.  These are those who were counted of the
    families of the sons of Gershon, all who served in the
    Tent of Meeting, whom Moses and Aaron counted
    according to the commandment of Yahweh.
     Those who were counted of the families of the
    sons of Merari, by their families, by their fathers'
    houses,  from thirty years old and upward even to
    fifty years old-everyone who entered into the service for work in the Tent of Meeting,  even those
    who were counted of them by their families, were
    three thousand two hundred.  These are those
    who were counted of the families of the sons of
    Merari, whom Moses and Aaron counted according
    to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
     All those who were counted of the Levites
    whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel
    counted, by their families and by their fathers'
    houses,  from thirty years old and upward even
    to fifty years old, everyone who entered in to
    do the work of service and the work of bearing
    burdens in the Tent of Meeting,  even those who
    were counted of them, were eight thousand five
    hundred eighty.  According to the commandment
    of Yahweh they were counted by Moses, everyone
    according to his service and according to his burden. Thus they were counted by him, as Yahweh
    commanded Moses.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Command
    the children of Israel that they put out of the camp
    every leper, everyone who has a discharge, and
    whoever is unclean by a corpse.  You shall put
    both male and female outside of the camp so that
    they don't defile their camp, in the midst of which I
    dwell.'
     The children of Israel did so, and put them
    outside of the camp; as Yahweh spoke to Moses, so
    the children of Israel did.
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to the
    children of Israel: 'When a man or woman commits
    any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against
    Yahweh, and that soul is guilty,  then he shall
    confess his sin which he has done; and he shall make
    restitution for his guilt in full, add to it the fifth
    part of it, and give it to him in respect of whom he
    has been guilty.  But if the man has no kinsman
    to whom restitution may be made for the guilt,
    the restitution for guilt which is made to Yahweh
    shall be the priest's, in addition to the ram of the
    atonement, by which atonement shall be made for
    him.  Every heave offering of all the holy things
    of the children of Israel, which they present to the
    priest, shall be his.  Every man's holy things shall
    be his; whatever any man gives the priest, it shall be
    his.' '
    Yahweh spoke to Moses,saying,  'Speak to the
    children of Israel, and tell them: 'If any man's wife
    goes astray and is unfaithful to him,  and a man
    lies with her carnally, and it is hidden from the eyes
    of her husband and this is kept concealed, and she
    is defiled, there is no witness against her, and she
    isn't taken in the act;  and the spirit of jealousy
    comes on him, and he is jealous of his wife and she
    is defiled; or if the spirit of jealousy comes on him,
    and he is jealous of his wife and she isn't defiled;
     then the man shall bring his wife to the priest,
    and shall bring her offering for her: one tenth of an
    ephah* of barley meal. He shall pour no oil on it,
    nor put frankincense on it, for it is a meal offering
    of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial, bringing
    iniquity to memory.  The priest shall bring her
    near, and set her before Yahweh.  The priest shall
    take holy water in an earthen vessel; and the priest
    shall take some of the dust that is on the floor of
    the tabernacle and put it into the water.  The
    priest shall set the woman before Yahweh, and let
    the hair of the woman's head go loose, and put the
    meal offering of memorial in her hands, which is the
    meal offering of jealousy. The priest shall have in
    his hand the water of bitterness that brings a curse.
    The priest shall cause her to take an oath and shall
    tell the woman, 'If no man has lain with you, and if
    you haven't gone aside to uncleanness, being under
    your husband's authority, be free from this water
    of bitterness that brings a curse.  But if you have
    gone astray, being under your husband's authority,
    and if you are defiled, and some man has lain with
    you besides your husband-'  then the priest shall
    cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing,
    and the priest shall tell the woman, 'May Yahweh
    make you a curse and an oath among your people,
    when Yahweh allows your thigh to fall away, and
    your body to swell;  and this water that brings a
    curse will go into your bowels, and make your body
    swell, and your thigh fall away.' The woman shall
    say, 'Amen, Amen.'
     ' 'The priest shall write these curses in a book,
    and he shall wipe them into the water of bitterness.
     He shall make the woman drink the water of
    bitterness that causes the curse; and the water that
    causes the curse shall enter into her and become
    bitter.  The priest shall take the meal offering of
    jealousy out of the woman's hand, and shall wave

      
    the meal offering before Yahweh, and bring it to
    the altar.  The priest shall take a handful of the
    meal offering, as its memorial portion, and burn it
    on the altar, and afterward shall make the woman
    drink the water.  When he has made her drink
    the water, then it shall happen, if she is defiled and
    has committed a trespass against her husband, that
    the water that causes the curse will enter into her
    and become bitter, and her body will swell, and her
    thigh will fall away; and the woman will be a curse
    among her people.  If the woman isn't defiled, but
    is clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive
    offspring.
     ' 'This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being
    under her husband, goes astray, and is defiled,  or
    when the spirit of jealousy comes on a man, and he
    is jealous of his wife; then he shall set the woman
    before Yahweh, and the priest shall execute on her
    all this law.  The man shall be free from iniquity,
    and that woman shall bear her iniquity.' '
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to
    the children of Israel, and tell them: 'When either
    man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow
    of a Nazirite, to separate himself to Yahweh,  he
    shall separate himself from wine and strong drink.
    He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of
    fermented drink, neither shall he drink any juice of
    grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.  All the days
    of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made
    of the grapevine, from the seeds even to the skins.
     ' 'All the days of his vow of separation no razor
    shall come on his head, until the days are fulfilled
    in which he separates himself to Yahweh. He shall
    be holy. He shall let the locks of the hair of his head
    grow long.
     ' 'All the days that he separates himself to
    Yahweh he shall not go near a dead body.  He shall
    not make himself unclean for his father, or for his
    mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they
    die, because his separation to God* is on his head.
    All the days of his separation he is holy to Yahweh.
     ' 'If any man dies very suddenly beside him, and
    he defiles the head of his separation, then he shall
    shave his head in the day of his cleansing. On the
    seventh day he shall shave it.  On the eighth day
    he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons
    to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting.
     The priest shall offer one for a sin offering, and
    the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement
    for him, because he sinned by reason of the dead,
    and shall make his head holy that same day.  He
    shall separate to Yahweh the days of his separation,
    and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass
    offering; but the former days shall be void, because
    his separation was defiled.
     ' 'This is the law of the Nazirite: when the days
    of his separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to
    the door of the Tent of Meeting,  and he shall offer
    his offering to Yahweh: one male lamb a year old
    without defect for a burnt offering, one ewe lamb a
    year old without defect for a sin offering, one ram
    without defect for peace offerings,  a basket of
    unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mixed with
    oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil with
    their meal offering and their drink offerings.  The
    priest shall present them before Yahweh, and shall
    offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.  He
    shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings
    to Yahweh, with the basket of unleavened bread.
    The priest shall offer also its meal offering and its
    drink offering.  The Nazirite shall shave the head
    of his separation at the door of the Tent of Meeting,
    take the hair of the head of his separation, and
    put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of
    peace offerings.  The priest shall take the boiled
    shoulder of the ram, one unleavened cake out of
    the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall
    put them on the hands of the Nazirite after he has
    shaved the head of his separation;  and the priest
    shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh.
    They are holy for the priest, together with the
    breast that is waved and the thigh that is offered.
    After that the Nazirite may drink wine.
     ' 'This is the law of the Nazirite who vows and
    of his offering to Yahweh for his separation, in addition to that which he is able to afford. According
    to his vow which he vows, so he must do after the
    law of his separation.' '
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to
    Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is how you shall
    bless the children of Israel.' You shall tell them,
     'Yahweh bless you, and keep you.
     Yahweh make his face to shine on you,
    and be gracious to you.
     Yahweh lift up his face toward you,
    and give you peace.'
     'So they shall put my name on the children of
    Israel; and I will bless them.'
    
     On the day that Moses had finished setting up
    the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified
    it with all its furniture, and the altar with all its
    vessels, and had anointed and sanctified them;  the
    princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses,
    gave offerings. These were the princes of the tribes.
    These are they who were over those who were
    counted;  and they brought their offering before
    Yahweh, six covered wagons and twelve oxen; a
    wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one
    an ox. They presented them before the tabernacle.
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Accept these
    from them, that they may be used in doing the
    service of the Tent of Meeting; and you shall give
    them to the Levites, to every man according to his
    service.'
     Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave
    them to the Levites.  He gave two wagons and
    four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to their
    service.  He gave four wagons and eight oxen to
    the sons of Merari, according to their service, under
    the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
     But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because

      
    the service of the sanctuary belonged to them; they
    carried it on their shoulders.
    The princes gave offerings for the dedication of
    the altar in the day that it was anointed. The princes
    gave their offerings before the altar.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'They shall offer their
    offering, each prince on his day, for the dedication
    of the altar.'

     When Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to
    speak with Yahweh, he heard his voice speaking to
    him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark
    of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim;
    and he spoke to him.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to
    Aaron, and tell him, 'When you light the lamps, the
    seven lamps shall give light in front of the lamp
    stand.' '
     Aaron did so. He lit its lamps to light the area
    in front of the lamp stand, as Yahweh commanded
    Moses.  This was the workmanship of the lamp
    stand, beaten work of gold. From its base to its
    flowers, it was beaten work. He made the lamp
    stand according to the pattern which Yahweh had
    shown Moses.
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Take the
    Levites from among the children of Israel, and
    cleanse them.  You shall do this to them to cleanse
    them: sprinkle the water of cleansing on them, let
    them shave their whole bodies with a razor, let
      
    them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.
     Then let them take a young bull and its meal
    offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and another
    young bull you shall take for a sin offering.  You
    shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting.
    You shall assemble the whole congregation of the
    children of Israel.  You shall present the Levites
    before Yahweh. The children of Israel shall lay their
    hands on the Levites,  and Aaron shall offer the
    Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering on the
    behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs
    to do the service of Yahweh.
     'The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads
    of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a
    sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to
    Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites.  You
    shall set the Levites before Aaron and before his
    sons, and offer them as a wave offering to Yahweh.
     Thus you shall separate the Levites from among
    the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.
     'After that, the Levites shall go in to do the
    service of the Tent of Meeting. You shall cleanse
    them, and offer them as a wave offering.  For they
    are wholly given to me from among the children
    of Israel; instead of all who open the womb, even
    the firstborn of all the children of Israel, I have
    taken them to me.  For all the firstborn among the
    children of Israel are mine, both man and animal.
    On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land
    of Egypt, I sanctified them for myself.  I have taken
    the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the
    children of Israel.  I have given the Levites as a gift
    to Aaron and to his sons from among the children
    of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel
    in the Tent of Meeting, and to make atonement for
    the children of Israel,so that there will be no plague
    among the children of Israel when the children of
    Israel come near to the sanctuary.'
     Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation
    of the children of Israel did so to the Levites.
    According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses
    concerning the Levites, so the children of Israel
    did to them.  The Levites purified themselves
    from sin, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron
    offered them for a wave offering before Yahweh
    and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse
    them.  After that, the Levites went in to do their
    service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron and
    before his sons: as Yahweh had commanded Moses
    concerning the Levites, so they did to them.
    Yahweh spoke to Moses,saying,  'This is what
    is assigned to the Levites: from twenty-five years
    old and upward they shall go in to wait on the
    service in the work of the Tent of Meeting;  and
    from the age of fifty years they shall retire from
    doing the work, and shall serve no more,  but
    shall assist their brothers in the Tent of Meeting,
    to perform the duty, and shall perform no service.
    This is how you shall have the Levites do their
    duties.'
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of
    Sinai, in the first month of the second year after
    they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
     'Let the children of Israel keep the Passover in its
    appointed season.  On the fourteenth day of this
    month, at evening, you shall keep it in its appointed
    season. You shall keep it according to all its statutes
    and according to all its ordinances.'
     Moses told the children of Israel that they
    should keep the Passover.  They kept the Passover
    in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the
    month at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so
    the children of Israel did.  There were certain men
    who were unclean because of the dead body of a
    man, so that they could not keep the Passover on
    that day, and they came before Moses and Aaron on
    that day.  Those men said to him, 'We are unclean
    because of the dead body of a man. Why are we
    kept back, that we may not offer the offering of
    Yahweh in its appointed season among the children
    of Israel?'
     Moses answered them, 'Wait, that I may hear
    what Yahweh will command concerning you.'
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Say to the
    children of Israel, 'If any man of you or of your
    generations is unclean by reason of a dead body,
    or is on a journey far away, he shall still keep the
    Passover to Yahweh.  In the second month, on the
    fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it; they
    shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
     They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor
    break a bone of it. According to all the statute of
    the Passover they shall keep it.  But the man who
    is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the
    Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
    Because he didn't offer the offering of Yahweh in its
    appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
     ' 'If a foreigner lives among you and desires
    to keep the Passover to Yahweh, then he shall do
    so according to the statute of the Passover, and
    according to its ordinance. You shall have one
    statute, both for the foreigner and for him who is
    born in the land.' '
     On the day that the tabernacle was raised
    up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the
    Tent of the Testimony. At evening it was over
    the tabernacle, as it were the appearance of fire,
    until morning.  So it was continually. The cloud
    covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.
     Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the
    Tent, then after that the children of Israel traveled; and in the place where the cloud remained,
    there the children of Israel encamped.  At the
    commandment of Yahweh, the children of Israel
    traveled, and at the commandment of Yahweh they
    encamped. As long as the cloud remained on the
    tabernacle they remained encamped.  When the
    cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days, then
    the children of Israel kept Yahweh's command, and
    didn't travel.  Sometimes the cloud was a few days
    on the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped, and
    according to the commandment of Yahweh they
    traveled.  Sometimes the cloud was from evening
    until morning; and when the cloud was taken up
      
    in the morning, they traveled; or by day and by
    night, when the cloud was taken up, they traveled.
     Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year
    that the cloud stayed on the tabernacle, remaining
    on it, the children of Israel remained encamped,
    and didn't travel; but when it was taken up, they
    traveled.  At the commandment of Yahweh they
    encamped, and at the commandment of Yahweh
    they traveled. They kept Yahweh's command, at the
    commandment of Yahweh by Moses.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Make two
    trumpets of silver. You shall make them of beaten
    work. You shall use them for the calling of the
    congregation and for the journeying of the camps.
     When they blow them, all the congregation shall
    gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of
    Meeting.  If they blow just one, then the princes,
    the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather
    themselves to you.  When you blow an alarm, the
    camps that lie on the east side shall go forward.
     When you blow an alarm the second time, the
    camps that lie on the south side shall go forward.
    They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.  But
    when the assembly is to be gathered together, you
    shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.
     'The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow
    the trumpets. This shall be to you for a statute
    forever throughout your generations.  When you
    go to war in your land against the adversary who
    oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with
    the trumpets. Then you will be remembered before
    Yahweh your God, and you will be saved from your
    enemies.
     'Also in the day of your gladness, and in your
    set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months,
    you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings;
    and they shall be to you for a memorial before your
    God. I am Yahweh your God.'
     In the second year, in the second month, on the
    twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken up
    from over the tabernacle of the covenant.  The
    children of Israel went forward on their journeys
    out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stayed
    in the wilderness of Paran.  They first went
    forward according to the commandment of Yahweh
    by Moses.
     First, the standard of the camp of the children
    of Judah went forward according to their armies.
    Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army.
    Nethanel the son of Zuar was over the army of the
    tribe of the children of Issachar.  Eliab the son of
    Helon was over the army of the tribe of the children
    of Zebulun.  The tabernacle was taken down; and
    the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who
    bore the tabernacle, went forward.  The standard
    of the camp of Reuben went forward according to
    their armies. Elizur the son of Shedeur was over
    his army.  Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai was
    over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon.
     Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the army of the
    tribe of the children of Gad.
     The Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary. The others set up the tabernacle before they
    arrived.
     The standard of the camp of the children of
    Ephraim set forward according to their armies.
    Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army.
     Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was over the army
    of the tribe of the children of Manasseh.  Abidan
    the son of Gideoni was over the army of the tribe of
    the children of Benjamin.
     The standard of the camp of the children of
    Dan, which was the rear guard of all the camps, set
    forward according to their armies. Ahiezer the son
    of Ammishaddai was over his army.  Pagiel the
    son of Ochran was over the army of the tribe of the
    children of Asher.  Ahira the son of Enan was over
    the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali.
     Thus were the travels of the children of Israel
    according to their armies; and they went forward.
     Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the
    Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, 'We are journeying
    to the place of which Yahweh said, 'I will give it to
    you.' Come with us, and we will treat you well; for
    Yahweh has spoken good concerning Israel.'
     He said to him, 'I will not go; but I will depart
    to my own land, and to my relatives.'
    Moses said, 'Don't leave us, please; because you
    know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and
    you can be our eyes.  It shall be, if you go with us
    -yes, it shall be-that whatever good Yahweh does
    to us, we will do the same to you.'
     They set forward from the Mount of Yahweh
    three days' journey. The ark of Yahweh's covenant
    went before them three days' journey, to seek out
    a resting place for them.  The cloud of Yahweh
    was over them by day, when they set forward from
    the camp.  When the ark went forward, Moses
    said, 'Rise up, Yahweh, and let your enemies be
    scattered! Let those who hate you flee before you!'
     When it rested, he said, 'Return, Yahweh, to the
    ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.'
    
     The people were complaining in the ears of
    Yahweh. When Yahweh heard it, his anger burned;
    and Yahweh's fire burned among them, and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.  The
    people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh,
    and the fire abated.  The name of that place
    was called Taberah,* because Yahweh's fire burned
    among them.
     The mixed multitude that was among them
    lusted exceedingly; and the children of Israel also
    wept again, and said, 'Who will give us meat to
    eat?  We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt
    for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and
    the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;  but now
    we have lost our appetite. There is nothing at all
    except this manna to look at.'  The manna was like
    coriander seed, and it looked like bdellium.  The

      
    people went around, gathered it, and ground it in
    mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and
    made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh
    oil.  When the dew fell on the camp in the night,
    the manna fell on it.
     Moses heard the people weeping throughout
    their families, every man at the door of his tent;
    and Yahweh's anger burned greatly; and Moses was
    displeased. Moses said to Yahweh, 'Why have you
    treated your servant so badly? Why haven't I found
    favor in your sight,that you lay the burden of all this
    people on me?  Have I conceived all this people?
    Have I brought them out, that you should tell me,
    'Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a
    nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their
    fathers?'  Where could I get meat to give all these
    people? For they weep before me, saying, 'Give us
    meat, that we may eat.'  I am not able to bear all
    this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.  If
    you treat me this way, please kill me right now, if I
    have found favor in your sight; and don't let me see
    my wretchedness.'
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Gather to me seventy
    men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be
    the elders of the people and officers over them; and
    bring them to the Tent of Meeting, that they may
    stand there with you.  I will come down and talk
    with you there. I will take of the Spirit which is on
    you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the
    burden of the people with you, that you don't bear
    it yourself alone.
     'Say to the people, 'Sanctify yourselves in
    preparation for tomorrow, and you will eat meat;
    for you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying,
    'Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with
    us in Egypt.' Therefore Yahweh will give you meat,
    and you will eat.  You will not eat just one day,
    or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty
    days,  but a whole month, until it comes out at
    your nostrils, and it is loathsome to you; because
    you have rejected Yahweh who is among you, and
    have wept before him, saying, 'Why did we come
    out of Egypt?' ' '
     Moses said, 'The people, among whom I am,
    are six hundred thousand men on foot; and you
    have said, 'I will give them meat, that they may
    eat a whole month.'  Shall flocks and herds be
    slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them?
    Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for
    them, to be sufficient for them?'
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Has Yahweh's hand
    grown short? Now you will see whether my word
    will happen to you or not.'
     Moses went out, and told the people Yahweh's
    words; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent.
     Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to
    him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and
    put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested
    on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.
     But two men remained in the camp. The name of
    one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad;
    and the Spirit rested on them. They were of those
    who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent;
    and they prophesied in the camp.  A young man
    ran, and told Moses, and said, 'Eldad and Medad are
    prophesying in the camp!'
     Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses,
    one of his chosen men, answered, 'My lord Moses,
    forbid them!'
     Moses said to him, 'Are you jealous for
    my sake? I wish that all Yahweh's people were
    prophets, that Yahweh would put his Spirit on
    them!'
     Moses went into the camp, he and the elders
    of Israel.  A wind from Yahweh went out and
    brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the
    camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's
    journey on the other side, around the camp, and
    about two cubits above the surface of the earth.
     The people rose up all that day, and all of that
    night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails.
    He who gathered least gathered ten homers; and
    they spread them all out for themselves around the
    camp.  While the meat was still between their
    teeth, before it was chewed, Yahweh's anger burned
    against the people, and Yahweh struck the people
    with a very great plague.  The name of that place
    was called Kibroth Hattaavah,* because there they
    buried the people who lusted.
     From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to
    Hazeroth; and they stayed at Hazeroth.
    
     Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because
    of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for
    he had married a Cushite woman.  They said, 'Has
    Yahweh indeed spoken only with Moses? Hasn't he
    spoken also with us?' And Yahweh heard it.
     Now the man Moses was very humble, more
    than all the men who were on the surface of the
    earth. Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, to Aaron,
    and to Miriam, 'You three come out to the Tent of
    Meeting!'
    The three of them came out.  Yahweh came
    down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the
    Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both
    came forward.  He said, 'Now hear my words. If
    there is a prophet among you, I, Yahweh, will make
    myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with
    him in a dream.  My servant Moses is not so. He
    is faithful in all my house.  With him, I will speak
    mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles;
    and he shall see Yahweh's form. Why then were
    you not afraid to speak against my servant, against
    Moses?'  Yahweh's anger burned against them;
    and he departed.
    The cloud departed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. Aaron
    looked at Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.
    Aaron said to Moses, 'Oh, my lord, please don't
    count this sin against us, in which we have done

      
    foolishly, and in which we have sinned.  Let her
    not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is
    half consumed when he comes out of his mother's
    womb.'
     Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, 'Heal her, God,
    I beg you!'
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'If her father had but
    spit in her face, shouldn't she be ashamed seven
    days? Let her be shut up outside of the camp seven
    days, and after that she shall be brought in again.'
     Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven
    days, and the people didn't travel until Miriam was
    brought in again.  Afterward the people traveled
    from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of
    Paran.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Send men,
    that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I
    give to the children of Israel. Of every tribe of their
    fathers, you shall send a man, every one a prince
    among them.'
     Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran
    according to the commandment of Yahweh. All of
    them were men who were heads of the children of
    Israel.  These were their names:
    Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
     Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
     Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
     Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.
     Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.
     Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
     Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
     Of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Manasseh,
    Gaddi the son of Susi.
     Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
     Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
     Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
     Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
     These are the names of the men who Moses sent
    to spy out the land. Moses called Hoshea the son of
    Nun Joshua.  Moses sent them to spy out the land
    of Canaan, and said to them, 'Go up this way by the
    South, and go up into the hill country.  See the
    land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein,
    whether they are strong or weak, whether they are
    few or many;  and what the land is that they dwell
    in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they
    are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in
    strongholds;  and what the land is, whether it is
    fertile or poor, whether there is wood therein, or
    not. Be courageous, and bring some of the fruit of
    the land.' Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes.
     So they went up, and spied out the land from
    the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of
    Hamath.  They went up by the South, and came
    to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the
    children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was
    built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)  They
    came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from
    there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and
    they bore it on a staff between two. They also
    brought some of the pomegranates and figs.  That
    place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the
    cluster which the children of Israel cut down from
    there.  They returned from spying out the land
    at the end of forty days.  They went and came
    to Moses, to Aaron, and to all the congregation of
    the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran,
    to Kadesh; and brought back word to them and to
    all the congregation. They showed them the fruit
    of the land.  They told him, and said, 'We came
    to the land where you sent us. Surely it flows with
    milk and honey, and this is its fruit. However, the
    people who dwell in the land are strong, and the
    cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw
    the children of Anak there.  Amalek dwells in the
    land of the South. The Hittite, the Jebusite, and the
    Amorite dwell in the hill country. The Canaanite
    dwells by the sea, and along the side of the Jordan.'
     Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said,
    'Let's go up at once, and possess it; for we are well
    able to overcome it!'
     But the men who went up with him said, 'We
    aren't able to go up against the people; for they
    are stronger than we.'  They brought up an evil
    report of the land which they had spied out to
    the children of Israel, saying, 'The land, through
    which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that
    eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we
    saw in it are men of great stature.  There we
    saw the Nephilim,* the sons of Anak, who come
    from the Nephilim. We were in our own sight as
    grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.'
    
     All the congregation lifted up their voice, and
    cried; and the people wept that night.  All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against
    Aaron. The whole congregation said to them, 'We
    wish that we had died in the land of Egypt, or that
    we had died in this wilderness!  Why does Yahweh
    bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our
    wives and our little ones will be captured or killed!
    Wouldn't it be better for us to return into Egypt?'
     They said to one another, 'Let's choose a leader,
    and let's return into Egypt.'
     Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before
    all the assembly of the congregation of the children
    of Israel.
     Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of
    Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the
    land, tore their clothes.  They spoke to all the
    congregation of the children of Israel, saying, 'The
    land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an
    exceedingly good land.  If Yahweh delights in us,
    then he will bring us into this land, and give it to
    us: a land which flows with milk and honey.  Only
    don't rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people
    of the land; for they are bread for us. Their defense
    is removed from over them, and Yahweh is with us.
    Don't fear them.'
     But all the congregation threatened to stone
    them with stones.
      
    Yahweh's glory appeared in the Tent of Meeting
    to all the children of Israel. Yahweh said to Moses,
    'How long will this people despise me? How long
    will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I
    have worked among them?  I will strike them with
    the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make
    of you a nation greater and mightier than they.'
     Moses said to Yahweh, 'Then the Egyptians
    will hear it; for you brought up this people in your
    might from among them.  They will tell it to the
    inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you
    Yahweh are among this people; for you Yahweh
    are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over
    them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud
    by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.  Now if
    you killed this people as one man, then the nations
    which have heard the fame of you will speak,saying,
     'Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people
    into the land which he swore to them, therefore he
    has slain them in the wilderness.'  Now please
    let the power of the Lord* be great, according as
    you have spoken, saying,  'Yahweh is slow to
    anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving
    iniquity and disobedience; and he will by no means
    clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
    on the children, on the third and on the fourth
    generation.'  Please pardon the iniquity of this
    people according to the greatness of your loving
    kindness, and just as you have forgiven this people,
    from Egypt even until now.'
     Yahweh said, 'I have pardoned according to
    your word;  but in very deed -as I live, and as
    all the earth shall be filled with Yahweh's glory
    -  because all those men who have seen my
    glory and my signs, which I worked in Egypt and
    in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten
    times, and have not listened to my voice;  surely
    they shall not see the land which I swore to their
    fathers, neither shall any of those who despised
    me see it.  But my servant Caleb, because he
    had another spirit with him, and has followed me
    fully, him I will bring into the land into which he
    went. His offspring shall possess it.  Since the
    Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley,
    tomorrow turn and go into the wilderness by the
    way to the Red Sea.'  Yahweh spoke to Moses
    and to Aaron, saying,  'How long shall I bear
    with this evil congregation that complain against
    me? I have heard the complaints of the children
    of Israel, which they complain against me.  Tell
    them, 'As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you have
    spoken in my ears, so I will do to you.  Your
    dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all
    who were counted of you, according to your whole
    number, from twenty years old and upward, who
    have complained against me,  surely you shall not
    come into the land concerning which I swore that
    I would make you dwell therein, except Caleb the
    son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.  But
    I will bring in your little ones that you said should
    be captured or killed, and they shall know the land
    which you have rejected. But as for you, your dead
    bodies shall fall in this wilderness.  Your children
    shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years,
    and shall bear your prostitution, until your dead
    bodies are consumed in the wilderness.  After the
    number of the days in which you spied out the land,
    even forty days, for every day a year, you will bear
    your iniquities, even forty years, and you will know
    my alienation.'  I, Yahweh, have spoken. I will
    surely do this to all this evil congregation who are
    gathered together against me. In this wilderness
    they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.'
     The men whom Moses sent to spy out the land,
    who returned and made all the congregation to
    murmur against him by bringing up an evil report
    against the land,  even those men who brought up
    an evil report of the land, died by the plague before
    Yahweh.  But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the
    son of Jephunneh remained alive of those men who
    went to spy out the land.
     Moses told these words to all the children of
    Israel, and the people mourned greatly. They rose
    up early in the morning and went up to the top of
    the mountain,saying, 'Behold, we are here, and will
    go up to the place which Yahweh has promised; for
    we have sinned.'
     Moses said, 'Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh, since it shall not prosper?
     Don't go up, for Yahweh isn't among you; that
    way you won't be struck down before your enemies.
     For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are
    before you, and you will fall by the sword because
    you turned back from following Yahweh; therefore
    Yahweh will not be with you.'
     But they presumed to go up to the top of
    the mountain. Nevertheless, the ark of Yahweh's
    covenant and Moses didn't depart out of the camp.
    Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites who lived in that mountain, and struck them
    and beat them down even to Hormah.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to the
    children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you have
    come into the land of your habitations, which I give
    to you,  and will make an offering by fire to Yahweh
    -a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a
    vow, or as a free will offering, or in your set feasts,
    to make a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, of the herd,
    or of the flock-  then he who offers his offering
    shall offer to Yahweh a meal offering of one tenth
    of an ephah* of fine flour mixed with one fourth of
    a hin of oil.  You shall prepare wine for the drink
    offering, one fourth of a hin, with the burnt offering
    or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.
     ' 'For a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed
    with the third part of a hin of oil;  and for the
    drink offering you shall offer the third part of a hin
    of wine, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.  When
    you prepare a bull for a burnt offering or for a

      
    sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings
    to Yahweh,  then he shall offer with the bull a
    meal offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine
    flour mixed with half a hin of oil;  and you shall
    offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, for
    an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to
    Yahweh.  Thus it shall be done for each bull, for
    each ram, for each of the male lambs, or of the
    young goats.  According to the number that you
    shall prepare,so you shall do to everyone according
    to their number.
     ' 'All who are native-born shall do these things
    in this way, in offering an offering made by fire,
    of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.  If a stranger
    lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may be
    among you throughout your generations, and will
    offer an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma
    to Yahweh, as you do, so he shall do.  For the
    assembly, there shall be one statute for you and
    for the stranger who lives as a foreigner, a statute
    forever throughout your generations. As you are,so
    the foreigner shall be before Yahweh. One law and
    one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger
    who lives as a foreigner with you.' '
    Yahweh spoke to Moses,saying,  'Speak to the
    children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you come
    into the land where I bring you,  then it shall be
    that when you eat of the bread of the land, you
    shall offer up a wave offering to Yahweh.  Of the
    first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a
    wave offering. As the wave offering of the threshing
    floor, so you shall heave it.  Of the first of your
    dough, you shall give to Yahweh a wave offering
    throughout your generations.
     ' 'When you err, and don't observe all these
    commandments which Yahweh has spoken to
    Moses-  even all that Yahweh has commanded
    you by Moses, from the day that Yahweh gave commandment
    and onward throughout your generations-  then it shall be,
    if it was done unwittingly,
    without the knowledge of the congregation, that
    all the congregation shall offer one young bull for
    a burnt offering, for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh,
    with its meal offering and its drink offering,
    according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin
    offering.  The priest shall make atonement for all
    the congregation of the children of Israel, and they
    shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have
    brought their offering, an offering made by fire to
    Yahweh, and their sin offering before Yahweh, for
    their error. all the congregation of the children of
    Israel shall be forgiven, as well as the stranger who
    lives as a foreigner among them; for with regard to
    all the people, it was done unwittingly.
     ' 'If a person sins unwittingly, then he shall
    offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering.
     The priest shall make atonement for the soul
    who errs when he sins unwittingly before Yahweh.
    He shall make atonement for him; and he shall be
    forgiven. You shall have one law for him who does
    anything unwittingly, for him who is native-born
    among the children of Israel, and for the stranger
    who lives as a foreigner among them.
     ' 'But the soul who does anything with a high
    hand, whether he is native-born or a foreigner,
    blasphemes Yahweh. That soul shall be cut off
    from among his people.  Because he has despised
    Yahweh's word, and has broken his commandment,
    that soul shall be utterly cut off. His iniquity shall
    be on him.' '
     While the children of Israel were in the wilderness,
    they found a man gathering sticks on the
    Sabbath day.  Those who found him gathering
    sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to
    all the congregation.  They put him in custody,
    because it had not been declared what should be
    done to him.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'The man shall surely
    be put to death. All the congregation shall stone
    him with stones outside of the camp.'  All the
    congregation brought him outside of the camp,
    and stoned him to death with stones, as Yahweh
    commanded Moses.
    Yahweh spoke to Moses,saying,  'Speak to the
    children of Israel, and tell them that they should
    make themselves fringes* on the borders of their
    garments throughout their generations, and that
    they put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue.
     It shall be to you for a fringe, that you may see
    it, and remember all Yahweh's commandments, and
    do them; and that you don't follow your own heart
    and your own eyes, after which you used to play the
    prostitute;  so that you may remember and do all
    my commandments, and be holy to your God.  I am
    Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land
    of Egypt, to be your God: I am Yahweh your God.'
    
     Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath,
    the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons
    of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben,
    took some men.  They rose up before Moses, with
    some of the children of Israel, two hundred fifty
    princes of the congregation, called to the assembly,
    men of renown.  They assembled themselves
    together against Moses and against Aaron, and said
    to them, 'You take too much on yourself, since all
    the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and
    Yahweh is among them! Why do you lift yourselves
    up above Yahweh's assembly?'
     When Moses heard it, he fell on his face.  He
    said to Korah and to all his company, 'In the
    morning, Yahweh will show who are his, and who
    is holy, and will cause him to come near to him.
    Even him whom he shall choose, he will cause to
    come near to him.  Do this: have Korah and all his
    company take censers,  put fire in them, and put
    incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow. It shall
    be that the man whom Yahweh chooses, he shall be
    holy. You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!'
     Moses said to Korah, 'Hear now, you sons of
    Levi!  Is it a small thing to you that the God of
    Israel has separated you from the congregation of

      
    Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service
    of Yahweh's tabernacle, and to stand before the
    congregation to minister to them;  and that he
    has brought you near, and all your brothers the
    sons of Levi with you? Do you seek the priesthood
    also?  Therefore you and all your company have
    gathered together against Yahweh! What is Aaron
    that you complain against him?'
     Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons
    of Eliab; and they said, 'We won't come up!  Is it
    a small thing that you have brought us up out of
    a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in
    the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a
    prince over us?  Moreover you haven't brought us
    into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given
    us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put
    out the eyes of these men? We won't come up.'
     Moses was very angry, and said to Yahweh,
    'Don't respect their offering. I have not taken
    one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of
    them.'
     Moses said to Korah, 'You and all your company go before Yahweh, you, and they, and Aaron,
    tomorrow.  Each man take his censer and put
    incense on it, and each man bring before Yahweh
    his censer, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and
    Aaron, each with his censer.'
     They each took his censer, and put fire in it,
    and laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the
    Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron.  Korah
    assembled all the congregation opposite them to
    the door of the Tent of Meeting.
    Yahweh's glory appeared to all the congregation.
     Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
     'Separate yourselves from among this congregation,
    that I may consume them in a moment!'
     They fell on their faces, and said, 'God, the God
    of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will
    you be angry with all the congregation?'
    Yahweh spoke to Moses,saying,  'Speak to the
    congregation, saying, 'Get away from around the
    tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!' '
     Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram;
    and the elders of Israel followed him.  He spoke
    to the congregation, saying, 'Depart, please, from
    the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing
    of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!'
     So they went away from the tent of Korah,
    Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. Dathan and
    Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their
    tents with their wives, their sons, and their little
    ones.
     Moses said, 'Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has
    sent me to do all these works; for they
    are not from my own mind.  If these men die
    the common death of all men, or if they experience
    what all men experience, then Yahweh hasn't sent
    me.  But if Yahweh makes a new thing, and the
    ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up with
    all that belong to them, and they go down alive into
    Sheol,* then you shall understand that these men
    have despised Yahweh.'
     As he finished speaking all these words, the
    ground that was under them split apart.  The
    earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up
    with their households, all of Korah's men, and all
    their goods.  So they, and all that belonged
    to them went down alive into Sheol. The earth
    closed on them, and they perished from among the
    assembly. All Israel that were around them fled at
    their cry; for they said, 'Lest the earth swallow us
    up!'  Fire came out from Yahweh, and devoured
    the two hundred fifty men who offered the incense.
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to
    Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take
    up the censers out of the burning, and scatter the
    fire away from the camp; for they are holy,  even
    the censers of those who sinned against their own
    lives. Let them be beaten into plates for a covering
    of the altar, for they offered them before Yahweh.
    Therefore they are holy. They shall be a sign to the
    children of Israel.'
     Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers
    which those who were burned had offered; and they
    beat them out for a covering of the altar,  to be a
    memorial to the children ofIsrael,to the end that no
    stranger who isn't of the offspring of Aaron, would
    come near to burn incense before Yahweh, that he
    not be as Korah and as his company; as Yahweh
    spoke to him by Moses.
     But on the next day all the congregation of
    the children of Israel complained against Moses and
    against Aaron, saying, 'You have killed Yahweh's
    people!'
     When the congregation was assembled against
    Moses and against Aaron, they looked toward the
    Tent of Meeting. Behold, the cloud covered it, and
    Yahweh's glory appeared.  Moses and Aaron came
    to the front of the Tent of Meeting.  Yahweh
    spoke to Moses, saying,  'Get away from among
    this congregation, that I may consume them in a
    moment!' They fell on their faces.
    Moses said to Aaron, 'Take your censer, put fire
    from the altar in it, lay incense on it, carry it quickly
    to the congregation, and make atonement for them;
    for wrath has gone out from Yahweh! The plague
    has begun.'
     Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. The plague had already begun
    among the people. He put on the incense, and made
    atonement for the people.  He stood between the
    dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
     Now those who died by the plague were fourteen
    thousand seven hundred, in addition to those who
    died about the matter of Korah.  Aaron returned
    to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and the
    plague was stopped.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to the
    children of Israel, and take rods from them, one for
    each fathers' house, of all their princes according to
    their fathers' houses, twelve rods. Write each man's
    name on his rod.  You shall write Aaron's name

      
    on Levi's rod. There shall be one rod for each head
    of their fathers' houses.  You shall lay them up in
    the Tent of Meeting before the covenant, where I
    meet with you.  It shall happen that the rod of the
    man whom I shall choose shall bud. I will make the
    murmurings of the children of Israel, which they
    murmur against you, cease from me.'
     Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all
    their princes gave him rods, for each prince one,
    according to their fathers' houses, a total of twelve
    rods. Aaron's rod was among their rods.  Moses
    laid up the rods before Yahweh in the Tent of the
    Testimony.
    On the next day, Moses went into the Tent of the
    Testimony; and behold, Aaron's rod for the house of
    Levi had sprouted, budded, produced blossoms, and
    bore ripe almonds.  Moses brought out all the rods
    from before Yahweh to all the children of Israel.
    They looked, and each man took his rod.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Put back the rod of
    Aaron before the covenant, to be kept for a token
    against the children of rebellion; that you may make
    an end of their complaining against me, that they
    not die.'  Moses did so. As Yahweh commanded
    him, so he did.
     The children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying,
    'Behold, we perish! We are undone! We are
    all undone!  Everyone who keeps approaching
    Yahweh's tabernacle, dies! Will we all perish?'
    
     Yahweh said to Aaron, 'You and your sons and
    your fathers' house with you shall bear the iniquity
    of the sanctuary; and you and your sons with you
    shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.  Bring
    your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of
    your father, near with you, that they may be joined
    to you, and minister to you; but you and your sons
    with you shall be before the Tent of the Testimony.
     They shall keep your commands and the duty of
    the whole Tent; only they shall not come near to
    the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that
    they not die, neither they nor you.  They shall be
    joined to you and keep the responsibility of the Tent
    of Meeting, for all the service of the Tent. A stranger
    shall not come near to you.
     'You shall perform the duty of the sanctuary
    and the duty of the altar, that there be no more
    wrath on the children of Israel.  Behold, I myself
    have taken your brothers the Levites from among
    the children of Israel. They are a gift to you,
    dedicated to Yahweh, to do the service of the Tent
    of Meeting.  You and your sons with you shall keep
    your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for
    that within the veil. You shall serve. I give you the
    service of the priesthood as a gift. The stranger who
    comes near shall be put to death.'
     Yahweh spoke to Aaron, 'Behold, I myself have
    given you the command of my wave offerings, even
    all the holy things of the children of Israel. I have
    given them to you by reason of the anointing, and
    to your sons, as a portion forever.  This shall
    be yours of the most holy things from the fire:
    every offering of theirs, even every meal offering
    of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every
    trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render
    to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.
    You shall eat of it like the most holy things. Every
    male shall eat of it. It shall be holy to you.
     'This is yours, too: the wave offering of their
    gift, even all the wave offerings of the children
    of Israel. I have given them to you, and to your
    sons and to your daughters with you, as a portion
    forever. Everyone who is clean in your house shall
    eat of it.
     'I have given to you all the best of the oil, all the
    best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first fruits
    of them which they give to Yahweh. The first-ripe
    fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to
    Yahweh, shall be yours. Everyone who is clean in
    your house shall eat of it.
     'Everything devoted in Israel shall be yours.
     Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh
    which they offer to Yahweh, both of man and
    animal, shall be yours. Nevertheless, you shall
    surely redeem the firstborn of man, and you shall
    redeem the firstborn of unclean animals.  You
    shall redeem those who are to be redeemed of them
    from a month old, according to your estimation, for
    five shekels of money, according to the shekel* of
    the sanctuary, which weighs twenty gerahs.
     'But you shall not redeem the firstborn of a
    cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn
    of a goat. They are holy. You shall sprinkle their
    blood on the altar, and shall burn their fat for
    an offering made by fire, for a pleasant aroma to
    Yahweh.  Their meat shall be yours, as the wave
    offering breast and as the right thigh, it shall be
    yours.  All the wave offerings of the holy things
    which the children of Israel offer to Yahweh, I have
    given you and your sons and your daughters with
    you, as a portion forever. It is a covenant of salt
    forever before Yahweh to you and to your offspring
    with you.'
     Yahweh said to Aaron, 'You shall have no
    inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any
    portion among them. I am your portion and your
    inheritance among the children of Israel.
     'To the children of Levi, behold, I have given all
    the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for
    their service which they serve, even the service of
    the Tent of Meeting.  Henceforth the children of
    Israel shall not come near the Tent of Meeting, lest
    they bear sin, and die.  But the Levites shall do
    the service of the Tent of Meeting, and they shall
    bear their iniquity. It shall be a statute forever
    throughout your generations. Among the children
    of Israel, they shall have no inheritance.  For the
    tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a
    wave offering to Yahweh, I have given to the Levites
    for an inheritance. Therefore I have said to them,
    'Among the children of Israel they shall have no
    inheritance.' '

     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Moreover
    you shall speak to the Levites, and tell them, 'When
    you take of the children of Israel the tithe which
    I have given you from them for your inheritance,
    then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for
    Yahweh, a tithe of the tithe.  Your wave offering
    shall be credited to you, as though it were the grain
    of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the
    wine press.  Thus you also shall offer a wave
    offering to Yahweh of all your tithes, which you
    receive of the children of Israel; and of it you shall
    give Yahweh's wave offering to Aaron the priest.
     Out of all your gifts, you shall offer every wave
    offering to Yahweh, of all its best parts, even the
    holy part of it.'
     'Therefore you shall tell them, 'When you
    heave its best from it, then it shall be credited to
    the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor,
    and as the increase of the wine press.  You may
    eat it anywhere, you and your households, for it is
    your reward in return for your service in the Tent
    of Meeting.  You shall bear no sin by reason of it,
    when you have heaved from it its best. You shall
    not profane the holy things of the children of Israel,
    that you not die.' '
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
     'This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has
    commanded. Tell the children of Israel to bring you
    a red heifer without spot, in which is no defect,
    and which was never yoked.  You shall give her
    to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her outside
    of the camp, and one shall kill her before his face.
     Eleazar the priest shall take some of her blood
    with his finger, and sprinkle her blood toward the
    front of the Tent of Meeting seven times. One shall
    burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her meat,
    and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn.  The
    priest shall take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet,
    and cast it into the middle of the burning of the
    heifer.  Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and
    he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he
    shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be
    unclean until the evening. He who burns her shall
    wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in
    water, and shall be unclean until the evening.
     'A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of
    the heifer, and lay them up outside of the camp in a
    clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation
    of the children of Israel for use in water for cleansing impurity. It is a sin offering.  He who gathers
    the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be
    unclean until the evening. it shall be to the children
    of Israel, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner
    among them, for a statute forever.
     'He who touches the dead body of any man
    shall be unclean seven days.  He shall purify
    himself with water on the third day, and on the
    seventh day he shall be clean; but if he doesn't
    purify himself the third day, then the seventh day
    he shall not be clean.  Whoever touches a dead
    person, the body of a man who has died, and doesn't
    purify himself, defiles Yahweh's tabernacle; and
    that soul shall be cut off from Israel; because the
    water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he
    shall be unclean. His uncleanness is yet on him.
     'This is the law when a man dies in a tent:
    everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone
    who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
     Every open vessel, which has no covering bound
    on it, is unclean.
     'Whoever in the open field touches one who is
    slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a
    man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
     'for the unclean, they shall take of the ashes of
    the burning of the sin offering; and running water
    shall be poured on them in a vessel.  A clean
    person shall take hyssop, dip it in the water, and
    sprinkle it on the tent, on all the vessels, on the
    persons who were there, and on him who touched
    the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave.
     The clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean
    on the third day, and on the seventh day. On the
    seventh day, he shall purify him. He shall wash
    his clothes and bathe himself in water, and shall
    be clean at evening.  But the man who shall be
    unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall
    be cut off from among the assembly, because he
    has defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh. The water
    for impurity has not been sprinkled on him. He
    is unclean.  It shall be a perpetual statute to
    them. He who sprinkles the water for impurity shall
    wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for
    impurity shall be unclean until evening.
     'Whatever the unclean person touches shall
    be unclean; and the soul that touches it shall be
    unclean until evening.'
    
     The children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the
    first month. The people stayed in Kadesh. Miriam
    died there, and was buried there.  There was
    no water for the congregation; and they assembled
    themselves together against Moses and against
    Aaron.  The people quarreled with Moses, and
    spoke, saying, 'We wish that we had died when
    our brothers died before Yahweh!  Why have you
    brought Yahweh's assembly into this wilderness,
    that we should die there, we and our animals? Why
    have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring
    us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of
    figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there
    any water to drink.'
     Moses and Aaron went from the presence of
    the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting,
    and fell on their faces. Yahweh's glory appeared
    to them.  Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Take
    the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and
    Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before
    their eyes, that it pour out its water. You shall bring
    water to them out of the rock; so you shall give the
    congregation and their livestock drink.'
     Moses took the rod from before Yahweh, as he
    commanded him.  Moses and Aaron gathered the
    assembly together before the rock, and he said to
    them, 'Hear now, you rebels! Shall we bring water
      
    out of this rock for you?' Moses lifted up his hand,
    and struck the rock with his rod twice, and water
    came out abundantly. The congregation and their
    livestock drank.
    Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, 'Because you
    didn't believe in me,to sanctify me in the eyes of the
    children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this
    assembly into the land which I have given them.'
     These are the waters of Meribah;* because the
    children of Israel strove with Yahweh, and he was
    sanctified in them.
    Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king
    of Edom, saying:
    'Your brother Israel says: You know all the travail
    that has happened to us;  how our fathers went
    down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long
    time. The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers.
     When we cried to Yahweh, he heard our voice,
    sent an angel, and brought us out of Egypt. Behold,
    we are in Kadesh, a city in the edge of your border.
     'Please let us pass through your land. We will
    not pass through field or through vineyard, neither
    will we drink from the water of the wells. We will go
    along the king's highway. We will not turn away to
    the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed
    your border.'
     Edom said to him, 'You shall not pass through
    me, lest I come out with the sword against you.'
     The children of Israel said to him, 'We will go
    up by the highway; and if we drink your water, I and
    my livestock, then I will give its price. Only let me,
    without doing anything else, pass through on my
    feet.'
     He said, 'You shall not pass through.' Edom
    came out against him with many people, and with
    a strong hand.  Thus Edom refused to give Israel
    passage through his border, so Israel turned away
    from him.
     They traveled from Kadesh, and the children of
    Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount
    Hor.  Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount
    Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,
     'Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall
    not enter into the land which I have given to the
    children of Israel, because you rebelled against my
    word at the waters of Meribah.  Take Aaron and
    Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;
     and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on
    Eleazar his son. Aaron shall be gathered, and shall
    die there.'
     Moses did as Yahweh commanded. They went
    up onto Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.  Moses stripped Aaron of his garments,
    and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there
    on the top of the mountain, and Moses and Eleazar
    came down from the mountain.  When all the
    congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept
    for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
    
     The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in
    the South, heard that Israel came by the way of
    Atharim. He fought against Israel, and took some
    of them captive.  Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh,
    and said, 'If you will indeed deliver this people
    into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their
    cities.'  Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel,
    and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly
    destroyed them and their cities. The name of the
    place was called Hormah.*
    They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the
    Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. The soul
    of the people was very discouraged because of the
    journey. The people spoke against God and against
    Moses: 'Why have you brought us up out of Egyptto
    die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, there is
    no water, and our soul loathes this disgusting food!'
     Yahweh sent venomous snakes among the people, and they bit the people. Many people of
    Israel died.  The people came to Moses, and said,
    'We have sinned, because we have spoken against
    Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh, that he
    take away the serpents from us.' Moses prayed for
    the people.
    Yahweh said to Moses, 'Make a venomous snake,
    and set it on a pole. It shall happen that everyone
    who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.'  Moses
    made a serpent of bronze, and set it on the pole. If a
    serpent had bitten any man, when he looked at the
    serpent of bronze, he lived.
     The children of Israel traveled, and encamped
    in Oboth.  They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is
    before Moab, toward the sunrise.  From there
    they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered.
     From there they traveled, and encamped on the
    other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness
    that comes out of the border of the Amorites; for
    the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and
    the Amorites. Therefore it is said in The Book of the
    Wars of Yahweh, 'Vaheb in Suphah, the valleys of the
    Arnon,  the slope of the valleys that incline toward
    the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab.'
     From there they traveled to Beer; that is the
    well of which Yahweh said to Moses, 'Gather the
    people together, and I will give them water.'
     Then Israel sang this song:
    'Spring up, well! Sing to it,
     the well, which the princes dug,
    which the nobles of the people dug,
    with the scepter, and with their poles.'
    From the wilderness they traveled to Mattanah;
     and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel
    to Bamoth;  and from Bamoth to the valley that
    is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which
    looks down on the desert.  Israel sent messengers
    to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,  'Let me
    pass through your land. We will not turn away into
    field or vineyard. We will not drink of the water of
    the wells. We will go by the king's highway, until we
    have passed your border.'
    Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his
    border, but Sihon gathered all his people together,
    and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and

      
    came to Jahaz. He fought against Israel.  Israel
    struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even
    to the children of Ammon; for the border of the
    children of Ammon was fortified.  Israel took
    all these cities. Israel lived in all the cities of
    the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages.
     For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of
    the Amorites, who had fought against the former
    king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand,
    even to the Arnon.  Therefore those who speak in
    proverbs say,
    'Come to Heshbon.
    Let the city of Sihon be built and established;
     for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,
    a flame from the city of Sihon.
    It has devoured Ar of Moab,
    The lords of the high places of the Arnon.
     Woe to you, Moab!
    You are undone, people of Chemosh!
    He has given his sons as fugitives,
    and his daughters into captivity,
    to Sihon king of the Amorites.
     We have shot at them.
    Heshbon has perished even to Dibon.
    We have laid waste even to Nophah,
    Which reaches to Medeba.'
     Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
     Moses sent to spy out Jazer. They took its villages,
    and drove out the Amorites who were there. They
    turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og the
    king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his
    people, to battle at Edrei.
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Don't fear him, for
    I have delivered him into your hand, with all his
    people, and his land. You shall do to him as you
    did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at
    Heshbon.'
     So they struck him, with his sons and all his
    people, until there were no survivors; and they
    possessed his land.
    
     The children of Israel traveled, and encamped
    in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.
     Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had
    done to the Amorites.  Moab was very afraid of
    the people, because they were many. Moab was
    distressed because of the children of Israel.  Moab
    said to the elders of Midian, 'Now this multitude
    will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up
    the grass of the field.'
    Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that
    time.  He sent messengers to Balaam the son of
    Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land
    of the children of his people, to call him, saying,
    'Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt.
    Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and
    they are staying opposite me.  Please come now
    therefore, and curse this people for me; for they
    are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail, that
    we may strike them, and that I may drive them out
    of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is
    blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.'
     The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian
    departed with the rewards of divination in their
    hand. They came to Balaam, and spoke to him the
    words of Balak.
     He said to them, 'Lodge here this night, and I
    will bring you word again, as Yahweh shall speak to
    me.' The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
     God came to Balaam, and said, 'Who are these
    men with you?'
     Balaam said to God, 'Balak the son of Zippor,
    king of Moab, has said to me,  'Behold, the people
    that has come out of Egypt covers the surface of the
    earth. Now, come curse them for me. Perhaps I
    shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive
    them out.' '
     God said to Balaam, 'You shall not go with
    them. You shall not curse the people, for they are
    blessed.'
     Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to
    the princes of Balak, 'Go to your land; for Yahweh
    refuses to permit me to go with you.'
     The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to
    Balak, and said, 'Balaam refuses to come with us.'
     Balak again sent princes, more, and more honorable than they.  They came to Balaam, and said
    to him, 'Balak the son of Zippor says, 'Please let
    nothing hinder you from coming to me,  for I will
    promote you to very great honor, and whatever you
    say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse
    this people for me.' '
     Balaam answered the servants of Balak, 'If
    Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold,
    I can't go beyond the word of Yahweh my God, to
    do less or more.  Now therefore please stay here
    tonight as well, that I may know what else Yahweh
    will speak to me.'
     God came to Balaam at night, and said to him,
    'If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with
    them; but only the word which I speak to you, that
    you shall do.'
    Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his
    donkey, and went with the princes of Moab. God's
    anger burned because he went; and Yahweh's angel
    placed himself in the way as an adversary against
    him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his
    two servants were with him.  The donkey saw
    Yahweh's angel standing in the way, with his sword
    drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned out of
    the path, and went into the field. Balaam struck
    the donkey, to turn her into the path.  Then
    Yahweh's angel stood in a narrow path between the
    vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on
    that side.  The donkey saw Yahweh's angel, and
    she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam's
    foot against the wall. He struck her again.
     Yahweh's angel went further, and stood in a
    narrow place, where there was no way to turn either
    to the right hand or to the left.  The donkey saw
    Yahweh's angel, and she lay down under Balaam.
    Balaam's anger burned, and he struck the donkey
    with his staff.
     Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and
    she said to Balaam, 'What have I done to you, that
    you have struck me these three times?'
      
     Balaam said to the donkey, 'Because you have
    mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand,
    for now I would have killed you.'
     The donkey said to Balaam, 'Am I not your
    donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long
    until today? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to
    you?'
    He said, 'No.'
     Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and
    he saw Yahweh's angel standing in the way, with
    his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his
    head, and fell on his face.  Yahweh's angel said to
    him, 'Why have you struck your donkey these three
    times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary,
    because your way is perverse before me.  The
    donkey saw me, and turned away before me these
    three times. Unless she had turned away from me,
    surely now I would have killed you, and saved her
    alive.'
     Balaam said to Yahweh's angel, 'I have sinned;
    for I didn't know that you stood in the way against
    me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back
    again.'
     Yahweh's angel said to Balaam, 'Go with the
    men; but you shall only speak the word that I shall
    speak to you.'
    So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
    When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went
    out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on
    the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost
    part of the border.  Balak said to Balaam, 'Didn't I
    earnestly send for you to summon you? Why didn't
    you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote
    you to honor?'
     Balaam said to Balak, 'Behold, I have come to
    you. Have I now any power at all to speak anything?
    I will speak the word that God puts in my mouth.'
     Balaam went with Balak, and they came to
    Kiriath Huzoth.  Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep,
    and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were
    with him.  In the morning, Balak took Balaam, and
    brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he
    saw from there part of the people.
    
    Balaam said to Balak, 'Build here seven altars for
    me, and prepare here seven bulls and seven rams for
    me.'
     Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak
    and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a
    ram.  Balaam said to Balak, 'Stand by your burnt
    offering, and I will go. Perhaps Yahweh will come
    to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you.'
    He went to a bare height.  God met Balaam, and
    he said to him, 'I have prepared the seven altars,
    and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every
    altar.'
    Yahweh put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said,
    'Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.'
    He returned to him, and behold, he was standing
    by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of
    Moab.  He took up his parable, and said,
    'From Aram has Balak brought me,
    the king of Moab from the mountains of the
    East.
    Come, curse Jacob for me.
    Come, defy Israel.
     How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?
    How shall I defy whom Yahweh has not defied?
     For from the top of the rocks I see him.
    From the hills I see him.
    Behold, it is a people that dwells alone,
    and shall not be listed among the nations.
     Who can count the dust of Jacob,
    or count the fourth part of Israel?
    Let me die the death of the righteous!
    Let my last end be like his!'
     Balak said to Balaam, 'What have you done to
    me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold,
    you have blessed them altogether.'
    He answered and said, 'Must I not take heed to
    speak that which Yahweh puts in my mouth?'
     Balak said to him, 'Please come with me to
    another place, where you may see them. You shall
    see just part of them, and shall not see them all.
    Curse them from there for me.'
    He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top
    of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a
    bull and a ram on every altar.  He said to Balak,
    'Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet
    God over there.'
     Yahweh met Balaam, and put a word in his
    mouth, and said, 'Return to Balak, and say this.'
     He came to him, and behold, he was standing
    by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with
    him. Balak said to him, 'What has Yahweh spoken?'
     He took up his parable, and said,
    'Rise up, Balak, and hear!
    Listen to me, you son of Zippor.
     God is not a man, that he should lie,
    nor a son of man, that he should repent.
    Has he said, and he won't do it?
    Or has he spoken, and he won't make it good?
     Behold, I have received a command to bless.
    He has blessed, and I can't reverse it.
     He has not seen iniquity in Jacob.
    Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel.
    Yahweh his God is with him.
    The shout of a king is among them.
     God brings them out of Egypt.
    He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.
     Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob;
    neither is there any divination with Israel.
    Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel,
    'What has God done!'
     Behold, a people rises up as a lioness.
    As a lion he lifts himself up.
    He shall not lie down until he eats of the prey,
    and drinks the blood of the slain.'
     Balak said to Balaam, 'Neither curse them at
    all, nor bless them at all.'
     But Balaam answered Balak, 'Didn't I tell you,
    saying, 'All that Yahweh speaks, that I must do?' '
    Balak said to Balaam, 'Come now, I will take you
    to another place; perhaps it will please God that you
    may curse them for me from there.'
      
     Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks
    down on the desert.  Balaam said to Balak, 'Build
    seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls
    and seven rams for me here.'
     Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a
    bull and a ram on every altar.
    
     When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to
    bless Israel, he didn't go, as at the other times,
    to use divination, but he set his face toward the
    wilderness.  Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw
    Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the
    Spirit of God came on him. He took up his parable,
    and said,
    'Balaam the son of Beor says,
    the man whose eyes are open says;
     he says, who hears the words of God,
    who sees the vision of the Almighty,
    falling down, and having his eyes open:
     How goodly are your tents, Jacob,
    and your dwellings, Israel!
     As valleys they are spread out,
    as gardens by the riverside,
    as aloes which Yahweh has planted,
    as cedar trees beside the waters.
     Water shall flow from his buckets.
    His seed shall be in many waters.
    His king shall be higher than Agag.
    His kingdom shall be exalted.
     God brings him out of Egypt.
    He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.
    He shall consume the nations his adversaries,
    shall break their bones in pieces,
    and pierce them with his arrows.
     He couched, he lay down as a lion,
    as a lioness;
    who shall rouse him up?
    Everyone who blesses you is blessed.
    Everyone who curses you is cursed.'
     Balak's anger burned against Balaam, and he
    struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam,
    'I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold,
    you have altogether blessed them these three times.
     Therefore, flee to your place, now! I thought to
    promote you to great honor; but, behold, Yahweh
    has kept you back from honor.'
     Balaam said to Balak, 'Didn't I also tell your
    messengers whom you sent to me,saying,  'If Balak
    would give me his house full of silver and gold, I
    can't go beyond Yahweh's word, to do either good
    or bad from my own mind. I will say what Yahweh
    says'? Now, behold, I go to my people. Come, I will
    inform you what this people shall do to your people
    in the latter days.'
     He took up his parable, and said,
    'Balaam the son of Beor says,
    the man whose eyes are open says;
     he says, who hears the words of God,
    knows the knowledge of the Most High,
    and who sees the vision of the Almighty,
    falling down, and having his eyes open:
     I see him, but not now.
    I see him, but not near.
    A star will come out of Jacob.
    A scepter will rise out of Israel,
    and shall strike through the corners of Moab,
    and crush all the sons of Sheth.
     Edom shall be a possession.
    Seir, his enemy, also shall be a possession,
    while Israel does valiantly.
     Out of Jacob shall one have dominion,
    and shall destroy the remnant from the city.'
     He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable,
    and said,
    'Amalek was the first of the nations,
    but his latter end shall come to destruction.'
     He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said,
    'Your dwelling place is strong.
    Your nest is set in the rock.
     Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted,
    until Asshur carries you away captive.'
     He took up his parable, and said,
    'Alas, who shall live when God does this?
    Butshipsshall come from the coast of Kittim.
    They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber.
    He also shall come to destruction.'
     Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his
    place; and Balak also went his way.
    
     Israel stayed in Shittim; and the people began
    to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab;
     for they called the people to the sacrifices of their
    gods. The people ate and bowed down to their gods.
     Israel joined himself to Baal Peor, and Yahweh's
    anger burned againstIsrael. Yahweh said to Moses,
    'Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up
    to Yahweh before the sun, that the fierce anger of
    Yahweh may turn away from Israel.'
     Moses said to the judges of Israel, 'Everyone kill
    his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor.'
     Behold, one of the children of Israel came and
    brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the
    sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were
    weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting.  When
    Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the
    priest, saw it, he rose up from the middle of the
    congregation, and took a spear in his hand.  He
    went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and
    thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and
    the woman through her body. So the plague was
    stopped among the children of Israel.  Those who
    died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Phinehas,
    the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has
    turned my wrath away from the children ofIsrael, in
    that he was jealous with my jealousy among them,
    so that I didn't consume the children of Israel in my
    jealousy.  Therefore say, 'Behold, I give to him my
    covenant of peace.  It shall be to him, and to his
    offspring after him, the covenant of an everlasting
    priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and
    made atonement for the children of Israel.' '
     Now the name of the man of Israel that was
    slain, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was
      
    Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers' house
    among the Simeonites. The name of the Midianite
    woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of
    Zur. He was head of the people of a fathers' house
    in Midian.
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Harass the
    Midianites, and strike them;  for they harassed you
    with their wiles, wherein they have deceived you in
    the matter of Peor, and in the incident regarding
    Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their
    sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the
    matter of Peor.'
    
     After the plague, Yahweh spoke to Moses and to
    Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,  'Take
    a census of all the congregation of the children of
    Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their
    fathers' houses, all who are able to go out to war
    in Israel.'  Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke
    with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at
    Jericho, saying,  'Take a census, from twenty years
    old and upward, as Yahweh commanded Moses and
    the children of Israel.'

    the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them

    Yahweh spoke to Moses,saying,  'To these the
    land shall be divided for an inheritance according to
    the number of names.  To the more you shall give
    the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall
    give the less inheritance. To everyone according to
    those who were counted of him shall his inheritance
    be given.  Notwithstanding, the land shall be
    divided by lot. According to the names of the tribes
    of their fathers they shall inherit.  According to
    the lot shall their inheritance be divided between
    the more and the fewer.'
     These are those who were counted of the
    Levites after their families: of Gershon, the family
    of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the
    Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites.
     These are the families of Levi: the family of
    the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the
    family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites,
    and the family of the Korahites. Kohath became
    the father of Amram.  The name of Amram's
    wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was
    born to Levi in Egypt. She bore to Amram Aaron
    and Moses, and Miriam their sister.  To Aaron
    were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
     Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange
    fire before Yahweh.  Those who were counted
    of them were twenty-three thousand, every male
    from a month old and upward; for they were not
    counted among the children of Israel, because there
    was no inheritance given them among the children
    of Israel.  These are those who were counted
    by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who counted the
    children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan
    at Jericho.  But among these there was not a man
    of them who were counted by Moses and Aaron the
    priest, who counted the children of Israel in the
    wilderness of Sinai.  For Yahweh had said of them,
    'They shall surely die in the wilderness.' There
    was not a man left of them, except Caleb the son of
    Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
    
     Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of
    Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the
    son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the
    son of Joseph came near. These are the names
    of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah,
    and Tirzah.  They stood before Moses, before
    Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the
    congregation, at the door of the Tent of Meeting,
    saying,  'Our father died in the wilderness. He
    was not among the company of those who gathered
    themselves together against Yahweh in the company of Korah, but he died in his own sin. He had
    no sons.  Why should the name of our father be
    taken away from among his family, because he had
    no son? Give to us a possession among the brothers
    of our father.'
     Moses brought their cause before Yahweh.
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'The daughters
    of Zelophehad speak right. You shall surely give
    them a possession of an inheritance among their
    father's brothers. You shall cause the inheritance of
    their father to pass to them. You shall speak to the
    children of Israel, saying, 'If a man dies, and has no
    son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to
    his daughter.  If he has no daughter, then you shall
    give his inheritance to his brothers.  If he has no
    brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his
    father's brothers.  If his father has no brothers,
    then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman
    who is next to him of his family, and he shall possess
    it. This shall be a statute and ordinance for the
    children of Israel, as Yahweh commanded Moses.' '
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Go up into this mountain of
    Abarim, and see the land which I have given
    to the children of Israel.  When you have seen it,
    you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron
    your brother was gathered;  because in the strife
    of the congregation, you rebelled against my word
    in the wilderness of Zin, to honor me as holy at the
    waters before their eyes.' (These are the waters of
    Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
    Moses spoke to Yahweh,saying,  'Let Yahweh,
    the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over
    the congregation,  who may go out before them,
    and who may come in before them, and who may
    lead them out, and who may bring them in, that the
    congregation of Yahweh may not be as sheep which
    have no shepherd.'
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Take Joshua the son
    of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your
    hand on him.  Set him before Eleazar the priest,
    and before all the congregation; and commission
    him in their sight.  You shall give authority to
    him, that all the congregation of the children of
    Israel may obey. He shall stand before Eleazar the
    priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment
    of the Urim before Yahweh. At his word they shall
    go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he
    and all the children of Israel with him, even all the
    congregation.'
    Moses did as Yahweh commanded him. He took
    Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest and
    before all the congregation.  He laid his hands on
    him and commissioned him, as Yahweh spoke by
    Moses.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Command
    the children of Israel, and tell them, 'See that you
    present my offering, my food for my offerings made
    by fire, as a pleasant aroma to me, in their due
    season.'  You shall tell them, 'This is the offering
    made by fire which you shall offer to Yahweh: male
    lambs a year old without defect, two day by day, for
    a continual burnt offering.  You shall offer the one
    lamb in the morning, and you shall offer the other
    lamb at evening,  with one tenth of an ephah* of

      
    fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with the fourth
    part of a hin of beaten oil.  It is a continual burnt
    offering which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a
    pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
     Its drink offering shall be the fourth part of a hin
    for each lamb. You shall pour out a drink offering
    of strong drink to Yahweh in the holy place.  The
    other lamb you shall offer at evening. As the meal
    offering of the morning, and as its drink offering,
    you shall offer it, an offering made by fire, for a
    pleasant aroma to Yahweh.
     ' 'On the Sabbath day, you shall offer two male
    lambs a year old without defect, and two tenths of
    an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering mixed
    with oil, and its drink offering:  this is the burnt
    offering of every Sabbath, in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.
     ' 'In the beginnings of your months, you shall
    offer a burnt offering to Yahweh: two young bulls,
    one ram, seven male lambs a year old without
    defect,  and three tenths of an ephah* of fine flour
    for a meal offering mixed with oil, for each bull;
    and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering
    mixed with oil, for the one ram;  and one tenth
    part of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering
    to every lamb, as a burnt offering of a pleasant
    aroma, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.  Their
    drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull,
    the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth
    part of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt offering
    of every month throughout the months of the year.
     Also, one male goat for a sin offering to Yahweh
    shall be offered in addition to the continual burnt
    offering and its drink offering.
     ' 'In the first month, on the fourteenth day of
    the month, is Yahweh's Passover. On the fifteenth
    day of this month shall be a feast. Unleavened bread
    shall be eaten for seven days.  In the first day
    shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no regular
    work,  but you shall offer an offering made by fire,
    a burnt offering to Yahweh: two young bulls, one
    ram, and seven male lambs a year old. They shall
    be without defect,  with their meal offering, fine
    flour mixed with oil. You shall offer three tenths for
    a bull, and two tenths for the ram.  You shall offer
    one tenth for every lamb of the seven lambs;  and
    one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement
    for you.  You shall offer these in addition to
    the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a
    continual burnt offering.  In this way you shall
    offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering
    made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh. It
    shall be offered in addition to the continual burnt
    offering and its drink offering.  On the seventh
    day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do
    no regular work.
     ' 'Also in the day of the first fruits, when you
    offer a new meal offering to Yahweh in your feast
    of weeks, you shall have a holy convocation. You
    shall do no regular work;  but you shall offer a
    burnt offering for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh: two
    young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs a year old;
     and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with
    oil, three tenths for each bull, two tenths for the
    one ram,  one tenth for every lamb of the seven
    lambs;  and one male goat, to make atonement for
    you.  Besides the continual burnt offering and its
    meal offering, you shall offer them and their drink
    offerings. See that they are without defect.
    
     ' 'In the seventh month, on the first day of
    the month, you shall have a holy convocation; you
    shall do no regular work. It is a day of blowing of
    trumpets to you.  You shall offer a burnt offering

    three tenths for the bull, two tenths for the ram,
     and one tenth for every lamb of the seven lambs;

    for you;  in addition to the burnt offering
    of the new moon with its meal offering, and the
    continual burnt offering with its meal offering, and
    their drink offerings, according to their ordinance,
    for a pleasant aroma, an offering made by fire to
    Yahweh.
     ' 'On the tenth day of this seventh month you
    shall have a holy convocation. You shall afflict your
    souls. You shall do no kind of work;  but you
    shall offer a burnt offering to Yahweh for a pleasant
    aroma: one young bull, one ram, seven male lambs
    a year old, all without defect;  and their meal
    offering, fine flour mixed with oil: three tenths for
    the bull, two tenths for the one ram,  one tenth
    for every lamb of the seven lambs;  one male goat

    atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and

     ' 'You shall offer these to Yahweh in your set
    feasts -in addition to your vows and your free
    will offerings-for your burnt offerings, your meal
    offerings, your drink offerings, and your peace
    offerings.' '
     Moses told the children of Israel according to
    all that Yahweh commanded Moses.
    
     Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the
    children of Israel, saying, 'This is the thing which
    Yahweh has commanded.  When a man vows a vow
    to Yahweh, or swears an oath to bind his soul with
    a bond, he shall not break his word. He shall do
    according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
     'Also, when a woman vows a vow to Yahweh
    and binds herself by a pledge, being in her father's
    house, in her youth,  and her father hears her vow
    and her pledge with which she has bound her soul,
    and her father says nothing to her, then all her vows
    shall stand, and every pledge with which she has
    bound her soul shall stand. But if her father forbids
    her in the day that he hears, none of her vows or
    of her pledges with which she has bound her soul,
    shall stand. Yahweh will forgive her, because her
    father has forbidden her.
     'If she has a husband, while her vows are on
    her, or the rash utterance of her lips with which
    she has bound her soul,  and her husband hears
    it, and says nothing to her in the day that he hears
    it; then her vows shall stand, and her pledges with
    which she has bound her soul shall stand.  But if
    her husband forbids her in the day that he hears it,
    then he makes void her vow which is on her and the
    rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound
    her soul. Yahweh will forgive her.
     'But the vow of a widow, or of her who is
    divorced, everything with which she has bound her
    soul shall stand against her.
     'If she vowed in her husband's house or bound
    her soul by a bond with an oath,  and her husband
    heard it, and held his peace at her and didn't
    disallow her, then all her vows shall stand, and
    every pledge with which she bound her soul shall
    stand.  But if her husband made them null and
    void in the day that he heard them, then whatever
    proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or
    concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand.
    Her husband has made them void. Yahweh will
    forgive her.  Every vow, and every binding oath
    to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it,
    or her husband may make it void.  But if her
    husband says nothing to her from day to day, then
    he establishes all her vows or all her pledges which
    are on her. He has established them, because he said
    nothing to herin the day that he heard them.  But
    if he makes them null and void after he has heard
    them, then he shall bear her iniquity.'
     These are the statutes which Yahweh commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth,
    in her father's house.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Avenge the
    children of Israel on the Midianites. Afterward you
    shall be gathered to your people.'
     Moses spoke to the people, saying, 'Arm men
    from among you for war, that they may go against
    Midian, to execute Yahweh's vengeance on Midian.
     You shall send one thousand out of every tribe,
    throughout all the tribes of Israel, to the war.'  So
    there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from every tribe, twelve thousand
    armed for war.  Moses sent them, one thousand
    of every tribe, to the war with Phinehas the son
    of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels
      
    of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in
    his hand.  They fought against Midian, as Yahweh
    commanded Moses. They killed every male.  They
    killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their
    slain: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five
    kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam the son
    of Beor with the sword.  The children of Israel
    took the women of Midian captive with their little
    ones; and all their livestock, all their flocks, and
    all their goods, they took as plunder.  All their
    cities in the places in which they lived, and all
    their encampments, they burned with fire.  They
    took all the captives, and all the plunder, both of
    man and of animal.  They brought the captives
    with the prey and the plunder, to Moses, and to
    Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the
    children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of
    Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.  Moses
    and Eleazar the priest, with all the princes of the
    congregation, went out to meet them outside of the
    camp.  Moses was angry with the officers of the
    army, the captains of thousands and the captains
    of hundreds, who came from the service of the
    war.  Moses said to them, 'Have you saved all the
    women alive?  Behold, these caused the children
    of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit
    trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor,
    and so the plague was among the congregation of
    Yahweh.  Now therefore kill every male among
    the little ones, and kill every woman who has known
    man by lying with him. But all the girls, who have
    not known man by lying with him, keep alive for
    yourselves.
     'Encamp outside of the camp for seven days.
    Whoever has killed any person, and whoever has
    touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third
    day and on the seventh day, you and your captives.
     You shall purify every garment, and all that is
    made of skin, and all work of goats' hair, and all
    things made of wood.'
     Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who
    went to the battle, 'This is the statute of the law
    which Yahweh has commanded Moses.  However
    the gold, and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin,
    and the lead,  everything that may withstand the
    fire, you shall make to go through the fire, and it
    shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with
    the water for impurity. All that doesn't withstand
    the fire you shall make to go through the water.
     You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day,
    and you shall be clean. Afterward you shall come
    into the camp.'
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Count the
    plunder that was taken, both of man and of animal,
    you, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the
    fathers' households of the congregation;  and
    divide the plunder into two parts: between the men
    skilled in war, who went out to battle, and all the
    congregation.  Levy a tribute to Yahweh of the
    men of war who went out to battle: one soul of
    five hundred; of the persons, of the cattle, of the
    donkeys, and of the flocks.  Take it from their half,
    and give it to Eleazar the priest, for Yahweh's wave
    offering.  Of the children of Israel's half, you shall
    take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons,
    of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of
    all the livestock, and give them to the Levites, who
    perform the duty of Yahweh's tabernacle.'
     Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Yahweh
    commanded Moses.
     Now the plunder, over and above the booty
    which the men of war took, was six hundred
    seventy-five thousand sheep,  seventy-two thousand head of cattle,  sixty-one thousand donkeys,
     and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the
    women who had not known man by lying with him.
    The half, which was the portion of those who went
    out to war, was in number three hundred thirtyseven thousand five hundred sheep;  and Yahweh's tribute of the 
    sheep was six hundred seventy-five. The cattle were thirty-six thousand, of which
    Yahweh's tribute was seventy-two.  The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred, of which
    Yahweh's tribute was sixty-one.  The persons
    were sixteen thousand, of whom Yahweh's tribute
    was thirty-two persons.  Moses gave the tribute,
    which was Yahweh's wave offering, to Eleazar the
    priest, as Yahweh commanded Moses. Of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided off from
    the men who fought  (now the congregation's
    half was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five
    hundred sheep,  thirty-six thousand head of cattle,  thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,  and
    sixteen thousand persons),  even of the children
    of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn out of every
    fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them to
    the Levites, who performed the duty of Yahweh's
    tabernacle, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
     The officers who were over the thousands
    of the army, the captains of thousands, and the
    captains of hundreds, came near to Moses.  They
    said to Moses, 'Your servants have taken the sum
    of the men of war who are under our command,
    and there lacks not one man of us.  We have
    brought Yahweh's offering, what every man found:
    gold ornaments, armlets, bracelets, signet rings,
    earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our
    souls before Yahweh.'
     Moses and Eleazar the priest took their gold,
    even all worked jewels.  All the gold of the
    wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh, of
    the captains of thousands, and of the captains of
    hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred
    fifty shekels.*  The men of war had taken booty,
    every man for himself.  Moses and Eleazar the
    priest took the gold of the captains of thousands
    and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tent of
    Meeting for a memorial for the children of Israel
    before Yahweh.
    
     Now the children of Reuben and the children
    of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock.
    They saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead.

      
    Behold, the place was a place for livestock.  Then
    the children of Gad and the children of Reuben
    came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest,
    and to the princes of the congregation, saying,
     'Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh,
    Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,  the land which Yahweh
    struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for
    livestock; and your servants have livestock.'  They
    said, 'If we have found favor in your sight, let this
    land be given to your servants for a possession.
    Don't bring us over the Jordan.'
     Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the
    children of Reuben, 'Shall your brothers go to war
    while you sit here?  Why do you discourage the
    heart of the children of Israel from going over into
    the land which Yahweh has given them?  Your
    fathers did so when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea
    to see the land.  For when they went up to the
    valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged
    the heart of the children of Israel, that they should
    not go into the land which Yahweh had given them.
    Yahweh's anger burned in that day, and he swore,
    saying,  'Surely none of the men who came up out
    of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall
    see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and
    to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me,
     except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite,
    and Joshua the son of Nun, because they have
    followed Yahweh completely.'  Yahweh's anger
    burned against Israel, and he made them wander
    back and forth in the wilderness forty years, until
    all the generation who had done evil in Yahweh's
    sight was consumed.
     'Behold, you have risen up in your fathers'
    place, an increase of sinful men, to increase the
    fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel.  For if you
    turn away from after him, he will yet again leave
    them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all
    these people.'
     They came near to him, and said, 'We will
    build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities
    for our little ones;  but we ourselves will be ready
    armed to go before the children of Israel, until we
    have brought them to their place. Our little ones
    shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the
    inhabitants of the land.  We will not return to our
    houses until the children of Israel have all received
    their inheritance.  For we will not inherit with
    them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond,
    because our inheritance has come to us on this side
    of the Jordan eastward.'
     Moses said to them: 'If you will do this thing, if
    you will arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to the
    war,  and every one of your armed men will pass
    over the Jordan before Yahweh until he has driven
    out his enemies from before him,  and the land is
    subdued before Yahweh; then afterward you shall
    return, and be clear of obligation to Yahweh and
    to Israel. Then this land shall be your possession
    before Yahweh.
     'But if you will not do so, behold, you have
    sinned against Yahweh; and be sure your sin will
    find you out.  Build cities for your little ones,
    and folds for your sheep; and do that which has
    proceeded out of your mouth.'
     The children of Gad and the children of Reuben
    spoke to Moses, saying, 'Your servants will do as
    my lord commands.  Our little ones, our wives,
    our flocks, and all our livestock shall be there in the
    cities of Gilead;  but your servants will pass over,
    every man who is armed for war, before Yahweh to
    battle, as my lord says.'
     So Moses commanded concerning them to
    Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun,
    and to the heads of the fathers' households of the
    tribes of the children of Israel.  Moses said to
    them, 'If the children of Gad and the children of
    Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every
    man who is armed to battle before Yahweh, and the
    land is subdued before you,then you shall give them
    the land of Gilead for a possession;  but if they
    will not pass over with you armed, they shall have
    possessions among you in the land of Canaan.'
     The children of Gad and the children of Reuben
    answered, saying, 'As Yahweh has said to your
    servants, so will we do.  We will pass over armed
    before Yahweh into the land of Canaan, and the
    possession of our inheritance shall remain with us
    beyond the Jordan.'
     Moses gave to them, even to the children of
    Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom
    of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of
    Og king of Bashan; the land, according to its cities
    and borders, even the cities of the surrounding
    land.  The children of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth,
    Aroer,  Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,  Beth
    Nimrah, and Beth Haran: fortified cities and folds
    for sheep.  The children of Reuben built Heshbon,
    Elealeh, Kiriathaim,  Nebo, and Baal Meon, (their
    names being changed), and Sibmah. They gave
    other names to the cities which they built.  The
    children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to
    Gilead, took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who
    were therein. Moses gave Gilead to Machirthe son
    of Manasseh; and he lived therein.  Jair the son
    of Manasseh went and took its villages, and called
    them Havvoth Jair.  Nobah went and took Kenath
    and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own
    name.
    
     These are the journeys of the children of Israel,
    when they went out of the land of Egypt by their
    armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.  Moses
    wrote the starting points of their journeys by the
    commandment of Yahweh. These are their journeys
    according to their starting points.  They traveled
    from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth
    day of the first month; on the next day after the
    Passover, the children of Israel went out with a high
    hand in the sight of all the Egyptians,  while the
    Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom
    Yahweh had struck among them. Yahweh also
    executed judgments on their gods.  The children
    of Israel traveled from Rameses, and encamped
    in Succoth.  They traveled from Succoth, and
      
    encamped in Etham, which is in the edge of the
    wilderness. They traveled from Etham, and turned
    back to Pihahiroth, which is before Baal Zephon,
    and they encamped before Migdol.  They traveled
    from before Hahiroth, and crossed through the
    middle of the sea into the wilderness. They went
    three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham,
    and encamped in Marah.  They traveled from
    Marah, and came to Elim. In Elim, there were
    twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and
    they encamped there.  They traveled from Elim,
    and encamped by the Red Sea.  They traveled
    from the Red Sea, and encamped in the wilderness
    of Sin.  They traveled from the wilderness of
    Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.  They traveled
    from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.  They
    traveled from Alush, and encamped in Rephidim,
    where there was no water for the people to drink.
     They traveled from Rephidim, and encamped
    in the wilderness of Sinai.  They traveled from
    the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped in Kibroth
    Hattaavah.  They traveled from Kibroth Hattaavah,
    and encamped in Hazeroth. They traveled
    from Hazeroth, and encamped in Rithmah.  They
    traveled from Rithmah, and encamped in Rimmon
    Perez.  They traveled from Rimmon Perez, and
    encamped in Libnah.  They traveled from Libnah,
    and encamped in Rissah.  They traveled
    from Rissah, and encamped in Kehelathah.  They
    traveled from Kehelathah, and encamped in Mount
    Shepher.  They traveled from Mount Shepher,
    and encamped in Haradah.  They traveled from
    Haradah, and encamped in Makheloth.  They
    traveled from Makheloth, and encamped in Tahath.
     They traveled from Tahath, and encamped in
    Terah.  They traveled from Terah, and encamped
    in Mithkah.  They traveled from Mithkah, and
    encamped in Hashmonah.  They traveled from
    Hashmonah, and encamped in Moseroth.  They
    traveled from Moseroth, and encamped in Bene
    Jaakan.  They traveled from Bene Jaakan, and
    encamped in Hor Haggidgad.  They traveled from
    HorHaggidgad, and encamped in Jotbathah. They
    traveled from Jotbathah, and encamped in Abronah.
     They traveled from Abronah, and encamped in
    Ezion Geber.  They traveled from Ezion Geber,
    and encamped at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.
     They traveled from Kadesh, and encamped in
    MountHor, in the edge of the land of Edom. Aaron
    the priest went up into Mount Hor at the commandment
    of Yahweh and died there, in the fortieth year
    after the children of Israel had come out of the
    land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day
    of the month.  Aaron was one hundred twenty-three
    years old when he died in Mount Hor.  The
    Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the South in
    the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the
    children of Israel.  They traveled from Mount Hor,
    and encamped in Zalmonah.  They traveled from
    Zalmonah, and encamped in Punon.  They traveled
    from Punon, and encamped in Oboth.  They
    traveled from Oboth, and encamped in Iye Abarim,
    in the border of Moab.  They traveled from Iyim,
    and encamped in Dibon Gad.  They traveled from
    Dibon Gad, and encamped in Almon Diblathaim.
     They traveled from Almon Diblathaim, and encamped
    in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.
    They traveled from the mountains of Abarim, and
    encamped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at
    Jericho.  They encamped by the Jordan, from
    Beth Jeshimoth even to Abel Shittim in the plains
    of Moab.  Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of
    Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,  Speak to
    the children ofIsrael, and tellthem, 'When you pass
    over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,  then you
    shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from
    before you, destroy all their stone idols, destroy all
    their molten images, and demolish all their high
    places.  You shall take possession of the land,
    and dwell therein; for I have given the land to you
    to possess it.  You shall inherit the land by lot
    according to your families; to the larger groups you
    shall give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller
    you shall give a smaller inheritance. Wherever the
    lot falls to any man, that shall be his. You shall
    inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.
     'But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of
    the land from before you, then those you let remain
    of them will be like pricks in your eyes and thorns in
    your sides. They will harass you in the land in which
    you dwell.  It shall happen that as I thought to do
    to them, so I will do to you.'
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'Command
    the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you
    come into the land of Canaan (this is the land that
    shall fall to you for an inheritance, even the land of
    Canaan according to its borders),  then your south
    quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along
    by the side of Edom, and your south border shall
    be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward.  Your
    border shall turn about southward of the ascent of
    Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and it shall pass
    southward of Kadesh Barnea; and it shall go from
    there to Hazar Addar, and pass along to Azmon.
     The border shall turn about from Azmon to the
    brook of Egypt, and it shall end at the sea.
     ' 'For the western border, you shall have the
    great sea and its border. This shall be your west
    border.
     ' 'This shall be your north border: from the
    great sea you shall mark out for yourselves Mount
    Hor.  From Mount Hor you shall mark out to the
    entrance of Hamath; and the border shall pass by
    Zedad.  Then the border shall go to Ziphron, and
    it shall end at Hazar Enan. This shall be your north
    border.
     ' 'You shall mark out your east border from
    Hazar Enan to Shepham.  The border shall go
    down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of
    Ain. The border shall go down, and shall reach to
    the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward.  The
    border shall go down to the Jordan, and end at the
    Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to its
    borders around it.' '
     Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, 'This is the land which you shall inherit by
      
    lot, which Yahweh has commanded to give to the
    nine tribes, and to the half-tribe;  for the tribe of
    the children of Reuben according to their fathers'
    houses, the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers' houses, and the half-tribe of
    Manasseh have received their inheritance.  The
    two tribes and the half-tribe have received their
    inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward,
    toward the sunrise.'
     Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,  'These are
    the names of the men who shall divide the land to
    you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
    the son of Nun. You shall take one prince of every
    tribe, to divide the land for inheritance.  These
    are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah,
    Caleb the son of Jephunneh.  Of the tribe of the
    children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
    of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.
     Of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Bukki
    the son of Jogli.  Of the children of Joseph: of the
    tribe of the children of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel
    the son of Ephod.  Of the tribe of the children
    of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.
     Of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince,
    Elizaphan the son of Parnach.  Of the tribe of
    the children of Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son
    of Azzan.  Of the tribe of the children of Asher
    a prince, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.  Of the
    tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince, Pedahel
    the son of Ammihud.'  These are they whom
    Yahweh commanded to divide the inheritance to
    the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab
    by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,  'Command the
    children of Israel to give to the Levites cities to
    dwell in out of their inheritance. You shall give
    pasture lands for the cities around them to the
    Levites.  They shall have the cities to dwell in.
    Their pasture lands shall be for their livestock, and
    for their possessions, and for all their animals.
     'The pasture lands of the cities, which you shall
    give to the Levites, shall be from the wall of the
    city and outward one thousand cubits* around it.
     You shall measure outside of the city for the east
    side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two
    thousand cubits, and for the westside two thousand
    cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits,
    the city being in the middle. This shall be the
    pasture lands of their cities.
     'The cities which you shall give to the Levites,
    they shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall
    give for the man slayer to flee to. Besides them you
    shall give forty-two cities.  All the cities which you
    shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities
    together with their pasture lands.  Concerning the
    cities which you shall give of the possession of the
    children of Israel, from the many you shall take
    many, and from the few you shall take few. Everyone according to his inheritance which he inherits
    shall give some of his cities to the Levites.' Yahweh
    spoke to Moses, saying,  'Speak to the children
    of Israel, and tell them, 'When you pass over the
    Jordan into the land of Canaan,  then you shall
    appoint for yourselves cities to be cities of refuge
    for you, that the man slayer who kills any person
    unwittingly may flee there.  The cities shall be for
    your refuge from the avenger, that the man slayer
    not die until he stands before the congregation for
    judgment.  The cities which you shall give shall
    be for you six cities of refuge.  You shall give
    three cities beyond the Jordan, and you shall give
    three cities in the land of Canaan. They shall be
    cities of refuge. These six cities shall be refuge for
    the children of Israel, for the stranger, and for the
    foreigner living among them, that everyone who
    kills any person unwittingly may flee there.
     ' 'But if he struck him with an instrument
    of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer. The
    murderer shall surely be put to death.  If he
    struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a
    man may die, and he died, he is a murderer. The
    murderer shall surely be put to death.  Or if he
    struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by
    which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer.
    The murderer shall surely be put to death.  The
    avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to
    death. When he meets him, he shall put him to
    death.  If he shoved him out of hatred, or hurled
    something at him while lying in wait, so that he
    died,  or in hostility struck him with his hand, so
    that he died, he who struck him shall surely be put
    to death. He is a murderer. The avenger of blood
    shall put the murderer to death when he meets him.
     ' 'But if he shoved him suddenly without hostility, or hurled on him anything without lying in
    wait,  or with any stone, by which a man may die,
    not seeing him, and cast it on him so that he died,
    and he was not his enemy and not seeking his harm,
     then the congregation shall judge between the
    striker and the avenger of blood according to these
    ordinances.  The congregation shall deliver the
    man slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood,
    and the congregation shall restore him to his city
    of refuge, where he had fled. He shall dwell therein
    until the death of the high priest, who was anointed
    with the holy oil.
     ' 'But if the man slayer shall at any time go
    beyond the border of his city of refuge where he
    flees,  and the avenger of blood finds him outside
    of the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger
    of blood kills the man slayer, he shall not be guilty
    of blood,  because he should have remained in his
    city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But
    after the death of the high priest, the man slayer
    shall return into the land of his possession.
     ' 'These things shall be for a statute and ordinance to you throughout your generations in all
    your dwellings.
     ' 'Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall
    be slain based on the testimony of witnesses; but
    one witness shall not testify alone against any
    person so that he dies.

     ' 'Moreover you shall take no ransom for the
    life of
    a murderer who is guilty of death. He shall
    surely be put to death.
     ' 'You shall take no ransom for him who has
    fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again
    to dwell in the land before the death of the priest.
     ' 'So you shall not pollute the land where you
    live; for blood pollutes the land. No atonement can
    be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it,
    but by the blood of him who shed it. You shall not
    defile the land which you inhabit, where
    I dwell; for
    I, Yahweh, dwell among the children of Israel.' '
    
     The heads of the fathers' households of the
    family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir,
    the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons
    of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and
    before the princes, the heads of the fathers' households
    of the children of Israel.  They said, 'Yahweh
    commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance
    by lot to the children of Israel. My lord was
    commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of
    Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
     If they
    are married to any of the sons of the other tribes
    of the children of Israel, then their inheritance will
    be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers,
    and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe
    to which they shall belong. So it will be taken
    away from the lot of our inheritance.
     When
    the jubilee of the children of Israel comes, then
    their inheritance will be added to the inheritance
    of the tribe to which they shall belong. So their
    inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance
    of the tribe of our fathers.' Moses commanded the children ofIsrael according to Yahweh's word,saying, 'The tribe of the sons
    of Joseph speak what is right.
     This is the thing
    which Yahweh commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, 'Let them be married to
    whom they think best, only they shall marry into
    the family of the tribe of their father.
     So shall
    no inheritance of the children of Israel move from
    tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall all keep
    the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
     Every
    daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe
    of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the
    family of the tribe of her father, that the children
    of Israel may each possess the inheritance of his
    fathers.
     So shall no inheritance move from one
    tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children
    of Israel shall each keep his own inheritance.' '
     The daughters of Zelophehad did as Yahweh
    commanded Moses:  for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah,
    Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad,
    were married to their father's brothers' sons.
     They were married into the families of the sons
    of Manasseh the son of Joseph. Their inheritance
    remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
     These are the commandments and the ordinances which Yahweh commanded by Moses to the
    children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan
    at Jericho.
