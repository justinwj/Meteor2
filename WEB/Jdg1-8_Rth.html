  The Book of
  Judges Chapters One through Eight:

   After the death of Joshua, the children of Israel
  asked of Yahweh,* saying, 'Who should go up for us
  first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?'
  Yahweh said, 'Judah shall go up. Behold, I have
  delivered the land into his hand.'
   Judah said to Simeon his brother, 'Come up
  with me into my lot, that we may fight against the
  Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your
  lot.' So Simeon went with him.  Judah went up, and
  Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites
  into their hand. They struck ten thousand men in
  Bezek. They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and they
  fought against him. They struck the Canaanites
  and the Perizzites.  But Adoni-Bezek fled. They
  pursued him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs
  and his big toes. Adoni-Bezek said, 'Seventy kings,
  having their thumbs and their big toes cut off,
  scavenged under my table. As I have done, so God
  has done to me.' They brought him to Jerusalem,
  and he died there.  The children of Judah fought
  against Jerusalem, took it, struck it with the edge of
  the sword, and set the city on fire.
   After that, the children of Judah went down
  to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the
  hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland.
   Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in
  Hebron. (The name of Hebron before that was
  Kiriath Arba.) They struck Sheshai, Ahiman, and
  Talmai.
   From there he went against the inhabitants of
  Debir. (The name of Debir before that was Kiriath
  Sepher.)  Caleb said, 'I will give Achsah my
  daughter as wife to the man who strikes Kiriath
  Sepher, and takes it.'  Othniel the son of Kenaz,
  Caleb's younger brother, took it, so he gave him
  Achsah his daughter as his wife.
   When she came, she got him to ask her father
  for a field. She got off her donkey; and Caleb said to
  her, 'What would you like?'
   She said to him, 'Give me a blessing; because
  you have set me in the land of the South, give me
  also springs of water.' Then Caleb gave her the
  upper springs and the lowersprings. The children
  of the Kenite, Moses' brother-in-law, went up out
  of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah
  into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south
  of Arad; and they went and lived with the people.
   Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they
  struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and
  utterly destroyed it. The name of the city was
  called Hormah.  Also Judah took Gaza with its
  border, and Ashkelon with its border, and Ekron
  with its border.  Yahweh was with Judah, and
  drove out the inhabitants of the hill country; for
  he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley,
  because they had chariots of iron.  They gave
  Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove
  the three sons of Anak out of there.  The children
  of Benjamin didn't drive out the Jebusites who
  inhabited Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with
  the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.
   The house of Joseph also went up against
  Bethel, and Yahweh was with them.  The house
  of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (The name of the
  city before that was Luz.) The watchers saw a man
  come out of the city, and they said to him, 'Please
  show us the entrance into the city, and we will deal
  kindly with you.'  He showed them the entrance
  into the city, and they struck the city with the edge
  of the sword; but they let the man and all his family
  go.  The man went into the land of the Hittites,
  built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its
  name to this day.
   Manasseh didn't drive out the inhabitants of
  Beth Shean and its towns, nor Taanach and its
  towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns,
  nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor
  the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the
  Canaanites would dwell in that land.  When Israel
  had grown strong, they putthe Canaanites to forced
  labor, and didn't utterly drive them out.  Ephraim
  didn't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer,
  but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
  Zebulun didn't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron,
  nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites
  lived among them, and became subject to forced
  labor.  Asher didn't drive out the inhabitants of
  Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor
  of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;
   but the Asheriteslived among the Canaanites, the
  inhabitants of the land, for they didn't drive them
  out.  Naphtali didn't drive out the inhabitants of
  Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath;
  but he lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants
  of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth
  Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to
  forced labor.  The Amorites forced the children
  of Dan into the hill country, for they would not
  allow them to come down to the valley;  but the
  Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon,
  and in Shaalbim. Yet the hand of the house of
  Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to
  forced labor.  The border of the Amorites was
  from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and
  upward.
  
   Yahweh's angel came up from Gilgal to Bochim.
  He said, 'I brought you out of Egypt, and have
  brought you to the land which I swore to give your
  fathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant
  with you.  You shall make no covenant with the
  inhabitants of this land. You shall break down their
  altars.' But you have not listened to my voice. Why
  have you done this? Therefore I also said, 'I will not
  drive them out from before you; but they shall be in
  your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.' '

   When Yahweh's angel spoke these words to all
  the children of Israel, the people lifted up their
  voice and wept.  They called the name of that
  place Bochim,* and they sacrificed there to Yahweh.
   Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the
  children of Israel each went to his inheritance to
  possess the land. The people served Yahweh all the
  days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who
  outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work
  of Yahweh that he had worked for Israel.  Joshua
  the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being
  one hundred ten years old.  They buried him in
  the border of his inheritance in Timnath Heres, in
  the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of the
  mountain of Gaash. After all that generation were
  gathered to their fathers, another generation arose
  after them who didn't know Yahweh, nor the work
  which he had done for Israel.  The children of
  Israel did that which was evil in Yahweh's sight, and
  served the Baals.  They abandoned Yahweh, the
  God of their fathers, who brought them out of the
  land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods
  of the peoples who were around them, and bowed
  themselves down to them; and they provoked Yahweh to anger.  They abandoned Yahweh, and
  served Baal and the Ashtaroth.  Yahweh's anger
  burned against Israel, and he delivered them into
  the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold
  them into the hands of their enemies all around,
  so that they could no longer stand before their
  enemies.  Wherever they went out, Yahweh's
  hand was against them for evil, as Yahweh had
  spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them; and they
  were very distressed.  Yahweh raised up judges,
  who saved them out of the hand of those who
  plundered them.  Yet they didn't listen to their
  judges; for they prostituted themselves to other
  gods, and bowed themselves down to them. They
  quickly turned away from the way in which their
  fathers walked, obeying Yahweh's commandments.
  They didn't do so. When Yahweh raised up judges
  for them, then Yahweh was with the judge, and
  saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the
  days of the judge; for it grieved Yahweh because of
  their groaning by reason of those who oppressed
  them and troubled them.  But when the judge was
  dead, they turned back, and dealt more corruptly
  than their fathers in following other gods to serve
  them and to bow down to them. They didn't cease
  what they were doing, or give up their stubborn
  ways.  Yahweh's anger burned against Israel;
  and he said, 'Because this nation transgressed my
  covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has
  not listened to my voice,  I also will no longer
  drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when
  he died from before them;  that by them I may
  test Israel, to see if they will keep Yahweh's way to
  walk therein, as their fathers kept it, or not.'  So
  Yahweh left those nations, without driving them
  out hastily. He didn't deliver them into Joshua's
  hand.
  
   Now these are the nations which Yahweh left,
  to test Israel by them, even as many as had not
  known all the wars of Canaan;  only that the
  generations of the children of Israel might know, to
  teach them war, at least those who knew nothing
  of it before:  the five lords of the Philistines,
  all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites
  who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal
  Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.  They were
  left to test Israel by them, to know whether they
  would listen to Yahweh's commandments, which he
  commanded their fathers by Moses.  The children
  of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites,
  the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the
  Jebusites.  They took their daughters to be their
  wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons
  and served their gods.  The children of Israel
  did that which was evil in Yahweh's sight, and
  forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals and
  the Asheroth.  Therefore Yahweh's anger burned
  against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of
  Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the
  children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight
  years. When the children ofIsrael cried to Yahweh,
  Yahweh raised up a savior to the children of Israel,
  who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz,
  Caleb's younger brother.  Yahweh's Spirit came
  on him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to
  war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim king
  of Mesopotamia into his hand. His hand prevailed
  against Cushan Rishathaim.  The land had rest
  forty years, then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
   The children of Israel again did that which was
  evil in Yahweh's sight, and Yahweh strengthened
  Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they
  had done that which was evil in Yahweh's sight.
   He gathered the children of Ammon and Amalek
  to himself; and he went and struck Israel, and they
  possessed the city of palm trees.  The children of
  Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
   But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh,
  Yahweh raised up a savior for them: Ehud the son
  of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. The
  children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the
  king of Moab.  Ehud made himself a sword which
  had two edges, a cubit* in length; and he wore it
  under his clothing on his right thigh.  He offered
  the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a
  very fat man.  When Ehud had finished offering
  the tribute, he sent away the people who carried
  the tribute.  But he himself turned back from the
  stone idols that were by Gilgal, and said, 'I have a
  secret message for you, O king.'
  The king said, 'Keep silence!' All who stood by
  him left him.
   Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by
  himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said,
  'I have a message from God to you.' He arose out
  of his seat.  Ehud put out his left hand, and took
  the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into

  his body.  The handle also went in after the blade;
  and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn't draw
  the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.
   Then Ehud went out onto the porch, and shut the
  doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.
   After he had gone, his servants came and saw
  that the doors of the upper room were locked. They
  said, 'Surely he is covering his feet in the upper
  room.' They waited until they were ashamed; and
  behold, he didn't open the doors of the upper room.
  Therefore they took the key and opened them, and
  behold, their lord had fallen down dead on the floor.
   Ehud escaped while they waited, passed beyond the stone idols, and escaped to Seirah. When
  he had come, he blew a trumpet in the hill country
  of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down
  with him from the hill country, and he led them.
   He said to them, 'Follow me; for Yahweh
  has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your
  hand.' They followed him, and took the fords of the
  Jordan against the Moabites, and didn't allow any
  man to pass over.  They struck at that time about
  ten thousand men of Moab, every strong man and
  every man of valor. No man escaped.  So Moab was
  subdued that day under the hand of Israel. Then the
  land had rest eighty years.
   After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who
  struck six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox
  goad. He also saved Israel.
  
   The children of Israel again did that which
  was evil in Yahweh's sight, when Ehud was dead.
   Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king
  of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of
  whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth
  of the Gentiles.  The children of Israel cried to
  Yahweh, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron;
  and he mightily oppressed the children of Israel for
  twenty years.  Now Deborah, a prophetess, the
  wife of Lappidoth, judged Israel at that time.  She
  lived under Deborah's palm tree between Ramah
  and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the
  children of Israel came up to her for judgment.  She
  sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
  Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, 'Hasn't Yahweh,
  the God of Israel, commanded, 'Go and lead the way
  to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand
  men of the children of Naphtali and of the children
  of Zebulun?  I will draw to you, to the river Kishon,
  Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots
  and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your
  hand.' '
   Barak said to her, 'If you will go with me, then I
  will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.'
   She said, 'I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the journey that you take won't be for your
  honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into a woman's
  hand.' Deborah arose, and went with Barak to
  Kedesh.
   Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together
  to Kedesh. Ten thousand men followed him; and
  Deborah went up with him. Now Heberthe Kenite
  had separated himself from the Kenites, even from
  the children of Hobab, Moses' brother-in-law, and
  had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim,
  which is by Kedesh.  They told Sisera that Barak
  the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.
   Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even
  nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people
  who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles,
  to the river Kishon.
  Deborah said to Barak, 'Go; for this is the day in
  which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand.
  Hasn't Yahweh gone out before you?' So Barak
  went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand
  men after him.  Yahweh confused Sisera, all his
  chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the
  sword before Barak. Sisera abandoned his chariot
  and fled away on his feet.  But Barak pursued the
  chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles;
  and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the
  sword. There was not a man left.
   However Sisera fled away on his feet to the
  tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there
  was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the
  house of Heber the Kenite.  Jael went out to meet
  Sisera, and said to him, 'Turn in, my lord, turn in
  to me; don't be afraid.' He came in to her into the
  tent, and she covered him with a rug.
   He said to her, 'Please give me a little water to
  drink; for I am thirsty.'
  She opened a container of milk, and gave him a
  drink, and covered him.
   He said to her, 'Stand in the door of the tent,
  and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says,
  'Is there any man here?' you shall say, 'No.' '
   Then Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent peg, and
  took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to
  him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it
  pierced through into the ground, for he was in a
  deep sleep; so he fainted and died.  Behold, as
  Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,
  and said to him, 'Come, and I will show you the man
  whom you seek.' He came to her; and behold, Sisera
  lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples.  So
  God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the
  children of Israel on that day.  The hand of the
  children of Israel prevailed more and more against
  Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed
  Jabin king of Canaan.
  
   Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam
  sang on that day, saying,
   'Because the leaders took the lead in Israel,
  because the people offered themselves willingly,
  be blessed, Yahweh!
   'Hear, you kings!
  Give ear, you princes!
  I, even I, will sing to Yahweh.
  I will sing praise to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
   'Yahweh, when you went out of Seir,
   : or, 'relieving himself'.
  Judges :  Judges :
  when you marched out of the field of Edom,
  the earth trembled, the sky also dropped.
  Yes, the clouds dropped water.
   The mountains quaked at Yahweh's presence,
  even Sinai at the presence of Yahweh, the God
  of Israel.
   'In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,
  in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied.
  The travelers walked through byways.
   The rulers ceased in Israel.
  They ceased until I, Deborah, arose;
  Until I arose a mother in Israel.
   They chose new gods.
  Then war was in the gates.
  Was there a shield or spear seen among forty
  thousand in Israel?
   My heart is toward the governors of Israel,
  who offered themselves willingly among the
  people.
  Bless Yahweh!
   'Speak, you who ride on white donkeys,
  you who sit on rich carpets,
  and you who walk by the way.
   Far from the noise of archers, in the places of
  drawing water,
  there they will rehearse Yahweh's righteous
  acts,
  the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.
  'Then Yahweh's people went down to the gates.
   'Awake, awake, Deborah!
  Awake, awake, utter a song!
  Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you
  son of Abinoam.'
   'Then a remnant of the nobles and the people
  came down.
  Yahweh came down for me against the mighty.
   Those whose root is in Amalek came out of
  Ephraim,
  after you, Benjamin, among your peoples.
  Governors come down out of Machir.
  Those who handle the marshal's staff came out
  of Zebulun.
   The princes of Issachar were with Deborah.
  As was Issachar, so was Barak.
  They rushed into the valley at his feet.
  By the watercourses of Reuben,
  there were great resolves of heart.
   Why did you sit among the sheepfolds?
  To hear the whistling for the flocks?
  At the watercourses of Reuben,
  there were great searchings of heart.
   Gilead lived beyond the Jordan.
  Why did Dan remain in ships?
  Asher sat still at the haven of the sea,
  and lived by his creeks.
   Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives
  to the death;
  Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.
   'The kings came and fought,
  then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by
  the waters of Megiddo.
  They took no plunder of silver.
   From the sky the stars fought.
  From their courses, they fought against Sisera.
   The river Kishon swept them away,
  that ancient river, the river Kishon.
  My soul, march on with strength.
   Then the horse hoofs stamped because of the
  prancing,
  the prancing of their strong ones.
   'Curse Meroz,' said Yahweh's angel.
  'Curse bitterly its inhabitants,
  because they didn't come to help Yahweh,
  to help Yahweh against the mighty.'
   'Jael shall be blessed above women,
  the wife of Heber the Kenite;
  blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
   He asked for water.
  She gave him milk.
  She brought him butter in a lordly dish.
   She put her hand to the tent peg,
  and her right hand to the workmen's hammer.
  With the hammer she struck Sisera.
  She struck through his head.
  Yes, she pierced and struck through his temples.
   At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay.
  At her feet he bowed, he fell.
  Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
   'Through the window she looked out, and cried:
  Sisera's mother looked through the lattice.
  'Why is his chariot so long in coming?
  Why do the wheels of his chariots wait?'
   Her wise ladies answered her,
  Yes, she returned answer to herself,
   'Have they not found, have they not divided the
  plunder?
  A lady, two ladies to every man;
  to Sisera a plunder of dyed garments,
  a plunder of dyed garments embroidered,
  of dyed garments embroidered on both sides,
  on the necks of the plunder?'
   'So let all your enemies perish, Yahweh,
  but let those who love him be as the sun when
  it rises in its strength.'
  Then the land had rest forty years.
  
   The children of Israel did that which was evil
  in Yahweh's sight, so Yahweh delivered them into
  the hand of Midian seven years.  The hand of
  Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of
  Midian the children of Israel made themselves the
  dens which are in the mountains, the caves, and
  the strongholds.  So it was, when Israel had
  sown, that the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the
  children of the east came up against them.  They
  encamped againstthem, and destroyed the increase
  of the earth, until you come to Gaza. They left no
  sustenance in Israel, and no sheep, ox, or donkey.
  Judges :  Judges :
   For they came up with their livestock and their
  tents. They came in as locusts for multitude. Both
  they and their camels were without number; and
  they came into the land to destroy it.  Israel
  was brought very low because of Midian; and the
  children of Israel cried to Yahweh.
   When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh
  because of Midian,  Yahweh sent a prophet to the
  children of Israel; and he said to them, 'Yahweh,the
  God of Israel, says, 'I brought you up from Egypt,
  and brought you out of the house of bondage.  I
  delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and
  out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove
  them out from before you, and gave you their land.
   I said to you, 'I am Yahweh your God. You shall
  not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you
  dwell.' But you have not listened to my voice.' '
   Yahweh's angel came and sat under the oak
  which was in Ophrah, that belonged to Joash the
  Abiezrite. His son Gideon was beating out wheat
  in the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.
  Yahweh's angel appeared to him, and said to him,
  'Yahweh is with you, you mighty man of valor!'
   Gideon said to him, 'Oh, my lord, if Yahweh
  is with us, why then has all this happened to us?
  Where are all his wondrous works which our fathers
  told us of, saying, 'Didn't Yahweh bring us up from
  Egypt?' But now Yahweh has cast us off, and
  delivered us into the hand of Midian.'
   Yahweh looked at him, and said, 'Go in this
  your might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian.
  Haven't I sent you?'
  He said to him, 'O Lord,* how shall Isave Israel?
  Behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I
  am the least in my father's house.'
   Yahweh said to him, 'Surely I will be with you,
  and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.'
   He said to him, 'If now I have found favor in
  your sight, then show me a sign that it is you who
  talk with me.  Please don't go away until I come
  to you, and bring out my present, and lay it before
  you.'
  He said, 'I will wait until you come back.'
   Gideon went in and prepared a young goat and
  unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal. He put the
  meat in a basket and he put the broth in a pot, and
  brought it out to him under the oak, and presented
  it.
   The angel of God said to him, 'Take the meat
  and the unleavened cakes, and lay them on this
  rock, and pour out the broth.'
  He did so.  Then Yahweh's angel stretched
  out the end of the staff that was in his hand, and
  touched the meat and the unleavened cakes; and
  fire went up out of the rock and consumed the meat
  and the unleavened cakes. Then Yahweh's angel
  departed out of his sight.
   Gideon saw that he was Yahweh's angel; and
  Gideon said, 'Alas, Lord Yahweh! Because I have
  seen Yahweh's angel face to face!'
   Yahweh said to him, 'Peace be to you! Don't be
  afraid. You shall not die.'
   Then Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh,
  and called it 'Yahweh is Peace.' To this day it is
  still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
   That same night, Yahweh said to him, 'Take
  your father's bull, even the second bull seven years
  old, and throw down the altar of Baal that your
  father has, and cut down the Asherah that is by it.
   Then build an altar to Yahweh your God on the
  top of this stronghold, in an orderly way, and take
  the second bull, and offer a burnt offering with the
  wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down.'
   Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and
  did as Yahweh had spoken to him. Because he feared
  his father's household and the men of the city, he
  could not do it by day, but he did it by night.
   When the men of the city arose early in the
  morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down,
  and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and
  the second bull was offered on the altar that was
  built.  They said to one another, 'Who has done
  this thing?'
  When they inquired and asked, they said,
  'Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.'
   Then the men of the city said to Joash, 'Bring
  out your son, that he may die, because he has
  broken down the altar of Baal, and because he has
  cut down the Asherah that was by it.'  Joash said
  to all who stood against him, 'Will you contend for
  Baal? Or will you save him? He who will contend for
  him, let him be put to death by morning! If he is a
  god, let him contend for himself, because someone
  has broken down his altar!'  Therefore on that
  day he named him Jerub-Baal, saying, 'Let Baal
  contend against him, because he has broken down
  his altar.'
   Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites
  and the children of the east assembled themselves
  together; and they passed over, and encamped in
  the valley of Jezreel.  But Yahweh's Spirit came
  on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer
  was gathered together to follow him.  He sent
  messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they also
  were gathered together to follow him. He sent
  messengers to Asher, to Zebulun, and to Naphtali;
  and they came up to meet them.
   Gideon said to God, 'If you will save Israel by
  my hand, as you have spoken,  behold, I will put a
  fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew
  on the fleece only, and it is dry on all the ground,
  then I'll know that you will save Israel by my hand,
  as you have spoken.'
   It was so; for he rose up early on the next day,
  and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew
  out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.
   Gideon said to God, 'Don't let your anger be
  kindled against me, and I will speak but this once.
  Please let me make a trial just this once with the
  fleece. Let it now be dry only on the fleece, and on
  all the ground let there be dew.'

   God did so that night; for it was dry on the
  fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
  
   Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him,rose up early and encamped
  beside the spring of Harod. Midian's camp was on
  the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in
  the valley.  Yahweh said to Gideon, 'The people
  who are with you are too many for me to give the
  Midianites into their hand, lest Israel brag against
  me, saying, 'My own hand has saved me.'  Now
  therefore proclaim in the ears of the people,saying,
  'Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return
  and depart from Mount Gilead.' ' So twenty-two
  thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand
  remained.
  Yahweh said to Gideon, 'There are still too many
  people. Bring them down to the water, and I will
  test them for you there. It shall be, that those
  whom I tell you, 'This shall go with you,' shall go
  with you; and whoever I tell you, 'This shall not go
  with you,' shall not go.'  So he brought down the
  people to the water; and Yahweh said to Gideon,
  'Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue,
  like a dog laps, you shall set him by himself; likewise
  everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.'
   The number of those who lapped, putting their
  hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but
  all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees
  to drink water.  Yahweh said to Gideon, 'I will
  save you by the three hundred men who lapped, and
  deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the
  other people go, each to his own place.'
   So the people took food in their hand, and their
  trumpets; and he sent all the rest of the men of
  Israel to their own tents, but retained the three
  hundred men; and the camp of Midian was beneath
  him in the valley.  That same night, Yahweh said
  to him, 'Arise, go down into the camp, for I have
  delivered it into your hand.  But if you are afraid
  to go down, go with Purah your servant down to the
  camp. You will hear what they say; and afterward
  your hands will be strengthened to go down into the
  camp.' Then went he down with Purah his servant
  to the outermost part of the armed men who were
  in the camp.
   The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the
  children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without
  number, as the sand which is on the seashore for
  multitude.
   When Gideon had come, behold, there was a
  man telling a dream to his fellow. He said, 'Behold,
  I dreamed a dream; and behold, a cake of barley
  bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, came to the
  tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside
  down, so that the tent lay flat.'
   His fellow answered, 'This is nothing other
  than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man
  of Israel. God has delivered Midian into his hand,
  with all the army.'
   It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the
  dream and its interpretation, that he worshiped.
  Then he returned into the camp of Israel and said,
  'Arise, for Yahweh has delivered the army of Midian
  into your hand!'
   He divided the three hundred men into three
  companies, and he put into the hands of all of them
  trumpets and empty pitchers, with torches within
  the pitchers.
   He said to them, 'Watch me, and do likewise.
  Behold, when I come to the outermost part of the
  camp, it shall be that, as I do, so you shall do.
   When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with
  me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all
  the camp, and shout, 'For Yahweh and for Gideon!' '
   So Gideon and the hundred men who were with
  him came to the outermost part of the camp in the
  beginning of the middle watch, when they had but
  newly set the watch. Then they blew the trumpets
  and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their
  hands.  The three companies blew the trumpets,
  broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their
  left hands and the trumpets in their right hands
  with which to blow; and they shouted, 'The sword
  of Yahweh and of Gideon!'  They each stood in
  his place around the camp, and all the army ran;
  and they shouted, and put them to flight.  They
  blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set
  every man's sword against his fellow and against
  all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth
  Shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel
  Meholah, by Tabbath.  The men of Israel were
  gathered together out of Naphtali, out of Asher, and
  out of all Manasseh, and pursued Midian.  Gideon
  sent messengers throughout all the hill country of
  Ephraim, saying, 'Come down against Midian and
  take the waters before them as far as Beth Barah,
  even the Jordan!' So all the men of Ephraim were
  gathered together and took the waters as far as Beth
  Barah, even the Jordan. They took the two princes
  of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at Oreb's
  rock, and Zeeb they killed at Zeeb's wine press, as
  they pursued Midian. Then they brought the heads
  of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.
  
  The men of Ephraim said to him, 'Why have you
  treated us this way, that you didn't call us when
  you went to fight with Midian?' They rebuked
  him sharply.  He said to them, 'What have I now
  done in comparison with you? Isn't the gleaning
  of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage
  of Abiezer?  God has delivered into your hand the
  princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb! What was I able
  to do in comparison with you?' Then their anger
  was abated toward him when he had said that.
   Gideon came to the Jordan and passed over, he
  and the three hundred men who were with him,
  faint, yet pursuing. He said to the men of Succoth,
  'Please give loaves of bread to the people who
  follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after
  Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.'
   The princes of Succoth said, 'Are the hands of
  Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we
  should give bread to your army?'
  Judges :  Judges :
  Gideon said, 'Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will
  tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness
  and with briers.'
   He went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them
  in the same way; and the men of Penuel answered
  him as the men of Succoth had answered. He spoke
  also to the men of Penuel, saying, 'When I come
  again in peace, I will break down this tower.'
   Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and
  their armies with them, about fifteen thousand
  men, all who were left of all the army of the children
  of the east; for there fell one hundred twenty
  thousand men who drew sword.  Gideon went
  up by the way of those who lived in tents on the
  east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the army;
  for the army felt secure.  Zebah and Zalmunna
  fled and he pursued them. He took the two kings
  of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and confused all
  the army.  Gideon the son of Joash returned from
  the battle from the ascent of Heres.  He caught
  a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired
  of him; and he described for him the princes of
  Succoth, and its elders, seventy-seven men.  He
  came to the men of Succoth, and said, 'See Zebah
  and Zalmunna, concerning whom you taunted me,
  saying, 'Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now
  in your hand, that we should give bread to your men
  who are weary?' '  He took the elders of the city,
  and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with
  them he taught the men of Succoth.  He broke
  down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the
  city.
   Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, 'What
  kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?'
  They answered, 'They were like you. They all
  resembled the children of a king.'
   He said, 'They were my brothers, the sons of
  my mother. As Yahweh lives, if you had saved them
  alive, I would not kill you.'
   He said to Jether his firstborn, 'Get up and kill
  them!' But the youth didn't draw his sword; for he
  was afraid, because he was yet a youth.
   Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, 'You rise and
  fall on us; for as the man is, so is his strength.'
  Gideon arose, and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and
  took the crescents that were on their camels' necks.
   Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, 'Rule
  over us, both you, your son, and your son's son also;
  for you have saved us out of the hand of Midian.'
   Gideon said to them, 'I will not rule over you,
  neither shall my son rule over you. Yahweh shall
  rule over you.'  Gideon said to them, 'I do have a
  request: that you would each give me the earrings
  of his plunder.' (For they had golden earrings,
  because they were Ishmaelites.)
   They answered, 'We will willingly give them.'
  They spread a garment, and every man threw the
  earrings of his plunder into it.  The weight of
  the golden earrings that he requested was one
  thousand and seven hundred shekels* of gold, in
  addition to the crescents, and the pendants, and
  the purple clothing that was on the kings of Midian,
  and in addition to the chains that were about their
  camels' necks.  Gideon made an ephod out of it,
  and put it in Ophrah, his city. Then all Israel played
  the prostitute with it there; and it became a snare to
  Gideon and to his house.  So Midian was subdued
  before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their
  heads no more. The land had rest forty years in the
  days of Gideon.
   Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his
  own house.  Gideon had seventy sons conceived
  from his body, for he had many wives.  His
  concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son,
  and he named him Abimelech.  Gideon the son of
  Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the
  tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
   As soon as Gideon was dead, the children
  of Israel turned again and played the prostitute
  following the Baals, and made Baal Berith their god.
   The children of Israel didn't remember Yahweh
  their God, who had delivered them out of the hand
  of all their enemies on every side;  neither did they
  show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, that is,
  Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had
  shown to Israel.

  The Book of
  Ruth:
  
   In the days when the judges judged, there was
  a famine in the land. A certain man of Bethlehem
  Judah went to live in the country of Moab with his
  wife and his two sons.  The name of the man was
  Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi. The
  names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion,
  Ephrathites of Bethlehem Judah. They came into
  the country of Moab and lived there.  Elimelech,
  Naomi's husband, died; and she was left with her
  two sons.  They took for themselves wives of
  the women of Moab. The name of the one was
  Orpah, and the name of the other was Ruth. They
  lived there about ten years.  Mahlon and Chilion
  both died, and the woman was bereaved of her two
  children and of her husband.  Then she arose
  with her daughters-in-law, that she might return
  from the country of Moab; for she had heard in
  the country of Moab how Yahweh* had visited his
  people in giving them bread.  She went out of the
  place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law
  with her. They went on the way to return to the
  land of Judah. Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, 'Go, return each of you to her mother's house.
  May Yahweh deal kindly with you, as you have dealt
  with the dead and with me. May Yahweh grant you
  that you may find rest, each of you in the house of
  her husband.'
  Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their
  voices, and wept.  They said to her, 'No, but we
  will return with you to your people.'
   Naomi said, 'Go back, my daughters. Why do
  you want to go with me? Do I still have sons in my
  womb, that they may be your husbands? Go back,
  my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have
  a husband. If I should say, 'I have hope,' if I should
  even have a husband tonight, and should also bear
  sons, would you then wait until they were grown?
  Would you then refrain from having husbands? No,
  my daughters, for it grieves me seriously for your
  sakes, for Yahweh's hand has gone out against me.'
  They lifted up their voices and wept again; then
  Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth stayed
  with her.  She said, 'Behold, your sister-in-law
  has gone back to her people and to her god. Follow
  your sister-in-law.'
   Ruth said, 'Don't urge me to leave you, and to
  return from following you, for where you go, I will
  go; and where you stay, I will stay. Your people will
  be my people, and your God my God.  Where
  you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May
  Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but
  death parts you and me.'
   When Naomi saw that she was determined to
  go with her, she stopped urging her.
   So they both went until they came to Bethlehem. When they had come to Bethlehem, all the
  city was excited about them, and they asked, 'Is this
  Naomi?'
   She said to them, 'Don't call me Naomi. Call
  me Mara,* for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly
  with me.  I went out full, and Yahweh has brought
  me home again empty. Why do you call me Naomi,
  since Yahweh has testified against me, and the
  Almighty has afflicted me?'  So Naomi returned,
  and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with
  her, who returned out of the country of Moab.
  They came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley
  harvest.
  
  Naomi had a relative of her husband's, a mighty
  man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his
  name was Boaz. Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi,
  'Let me now go to the field, and glean among the
  ears of grain after him in whose sight I find favor.'
  She said to her, 'Go, my daughter.'  She went,
  and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers;
  and she happened to come to the portion of the
  field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of
  Elimelech.
   Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to
  the reapers, 'May Yahweh be with you.'
  They answered him, 'May Yahweh bless you.'
   Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over
  the reapers, 'Whose young lady is this?'
   The servant who was set over the reapers answered, 'It is the Moabite lady who came back with
  Naomi out of the country of Moab. She said, 'Please
  let me glean and gather after the reapers among
  the sheaves.' So she came, and has continued even
  from the morning until now, except that she rested
  a little in the house.'
   Then Boaz said to Ruth, 'Listen, my daughter.
  Don't go to glean in another field, and don't go from
  here, but stay here close to my maidens.  Let your
  eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after
  them. Haven't I commanded the young men not to
  touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels,
  and drink from that which the young men have
  drawn.'
   Then she fell on her face and bowed herself
  to the ground, and said to him, 'Why have I found
  favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge
  of me, since I am a foreigner?'
   Boaz answered her, 'I have been told all about
  what you have done for your mother-in-law since
  the death of your husband, and how you have left
  your father, your mother, and the land of your
  birth, and have come to a people that you didn't
  know before.  May Yahweh repay your work, and
  a full reward be given to you from Yahweh, the God
  of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take
  refuge.'

    
   Then she said, 'Let me find favor in your
  sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and
  because you have spoken kindly to your servant,
  though I am not as one of your servants.'
   At meal time Boaz said to her, 'Come here, and
  eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.'
  She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her
  parched grain. She ate, was satisfied, and left some
  of it.  When she had risen up to glean, Boaz
  commanded his young men, saying, 'Let her glean
  even among the sheaves, and don't reproach her.
   Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and
  leave it. Let her glean, and don't rebuke her.'
   So she gleaned in the field until evening; and
  she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was
  about an ephah* of barley.  She took it up, and
  went into the city. Then her mother-in-law saw
  what she had gleaned; and she brought out and gave
  to her that which she had left after she had enough.
   Her mother-in-law said to her, 'Where have
  you gleaned today? Where have you worked?
  Blessed be he who noticed you.'
  She told her mother-in-law with whom she had
  worked, 'The man's name with whom I worked
  today is Boaz.'  Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, 'May he be blessed by Yahweh, who has not
  abandoned his kindness to the living and to the
  dead.' Naomi said to her, 'The man is a close
  relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.'
   Ruth the Moabitess said, 'Yes, he said to me,
  'You shall stay close to my young men until they
  have finished all my harvest.' '
   Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, 'It
  is good, my daughter, that you go out with his
  maidens, and that they not meet you in any other
  field.'  So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz,
  to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat
  harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.
  
   Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, 'My
  daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may
  be well with you?  Now isn't Boaz our kinsman,
  with whose maidens you were? Behold, he will be
  winnowing barley tonight on the threshing floor.
   Therefore wash yourself, anoint yourself, get
  dressed, and go down to the threshing floor; but
  don't make yourself known to the man until he has
  finished eating and drinking.  It shall be, when he
  lies down, that you shall note the place where he is
  lying. Then you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lie
  down. Then he will tell you what to do.'
   She said to her, 'All that you say, I will do.'
   She went down to the threshing floor, and did
  everything that her mother-in-law told her. When
  Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry,
  he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain.
  She came softly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.
   At midnight, the man was startled and turned
  himself; and behold, a woman lay at his feet.  He
  said, 'Who are you?'
  She answered, 'I am Ruth your servant. Therefore spread the corner of your garment over your
  servant; for you are a near kinsman.'
   He said, 'You are blessed by Yahweh, my
  daughter. You have shown more kindness in the
  latter end than at the beginning, because you didn't
  follow young men, whether poor or rich. Now, my
  daughter, don't be afraid. I will do to you all that you
  say; for all the city of my people knows that you are
  a worthy woman.  Now it is true that I am a near
  kinsman. However, there is a kinsman nearer than
  I.  Stay this night, and in the morning, if he will
  perform for you the part of a kinsman, good. Let
  him do the kinsman's duty. But if he will not do the
  duty of a kinsman for you, then I will do the duty of
  a kinsman for you, as Yahweh lives. Lie down until
  the morning.'
   She lay at his feet until the morning, then she
  rose up before one could discern another. For he
  said, 'Let it not be known that the woman came to
  the threshing floor.'  He said, 'Bring the mantle
  that is on you, and hold it.' She held it; and he
  measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her;
  then he went into the city.
   When she came to her mother-in-law, she said,
  'How did it go, my daughter?'
  She told her all that the man had done for her.
   She said, 'He gave me these six measures of
  barley; for he said, 'Don't go empty to your mother-in-law.' '
   Then she said, 'Wait, my daughter, until you
  know what will happen; for the man will not rest
  until he has settled this today.'
  
   Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down
  there. Behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz
  spoke came by. Boaz said to him, 'Come over here,
  friend, and sit down!' He came over, and sat down.
   Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city, and
  said, 'Sit down here,' and they sat down.  He said
  to the near kinsman, 'Naomi, who has come back
  out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of
  land, which was our brother Elimelech's.  I thought
  I should tell you,saying, 'Buy it before those who sit
  here, and before the elders of my people.' If you will
  redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it,
  then tell me, that I may know. For there is no one
  to redeem it besides you; and I am after you.'
  He said, 'I will redeem it.'
   Then Boaz said, 'On the day you buy the field
  from the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also from
  Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up
  the name of the dead on his inheritance.'
   The near kinsman said, 'I can't redeem it for
  myself, lest I endanger my own inheritance. Take
  my right of redemption for yourself; for I can't
  redeem it.'
  Now this was the custom in former time in Israel
  concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging,
  to confirm all things: a man took off his sandal,
  and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the way
  of formalizing transactions in Israel.  So the near

    
  kinsman said to Boaz, 'Buy it for yourself,' then he
  took off his sandal.  Boaz said to the elders and to all the people,
  'You are witnesses today, that
  I have bought all
  that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and
  Mahlon's, from the hand of Naomi.  Moreover,
  Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon,
  I have
  purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of
  the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the
  dead may not be cut off from among his brothers
  and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses
  today.'
   All the people who were in the gate, and the
  elders, said, 'We are witnesses. May Yahweh make
  the woman who has come into your house like
  Rachel and like Leah, which both built the house
  of Israel; and treat you worthily in Ephrathah, and
  be famous in Bethlehem.  Let your house be like
  the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of
  the offspring
  * which Yahweh will give you by this
  young woman.'
   So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife;
  and he went in to her, and Yahweh enabled her to
  conceive, and she bore
  a son.  The women said to
  Naomi, 'Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you
  today without
  a near kinsman. Let his name be
  famous in Israel.  He shall be to you
  a restorer
  of life and sustain you in your old age; for your
  daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you
  than seven sons, has given birth to him.'  Naomi
  took the child, laid him in her bosom, and became
  nurse to him.  The women, her neighbors, gave
  him
  a name, saying, 'A son is born to Naomi'. They
  named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the
  father of David.
   Now this is the history of the generations of
  Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron,  and
  Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became
  the father of Amminadab,  and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became
  the father of Salmon,  and Salmon became the
  father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed,
   and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse
  became the father of David.
