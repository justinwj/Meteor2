    The Fifth Book of Moses,
    Commonly Called
    Deuteronomy:
    
     These are the words which Moses spoke to
    all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in
    the Arabah opposite Suf, between Paran, Tophel,
    Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.  It is eleven days'
    journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir
    to Kadesh Barnea.  In the fortieth year, in the
    eleventh month, on the first day of the month,
    Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to
    all that Yahweh* had given him in commandment
    to them,  after he had struck Sihon the king of the
    Amorites who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of
    Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.  Beyond
    the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to
    declare this law, saying,  'Yahweh our God spoke
    to us in Horeb, saying, 'You have lived long enough
    at this mountain. Turn, and take your journey, and
    go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the
    places near there: in the Arabah, in the hill country,
    in the lowland, in the South, by the seashore, in the
    land of the Canaanites, and in Lebanon as far as the
    great river, the river Euphrates.  Behold, I have
    set the land before you. Go in and possess the land
    which Yahweh swore to your fathers-to Abraham,
    to Isaac, and to Jacob-to give to them and to their
    offspring after them.' '
     I spoke to you at that time, saying, 'I am not
    able to bear you myself alone.  Yahweh your God
    has multiplied you, and behold, you are today  as the 
    stars of the sky for multitude.  May Yahweh, the
    God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as
    many as you are and bless you, as he has promised
    you!  How can I myself alone bear your problems,
    your burdens, and your strife?  Take wise men
    of understanding who are respected among your
    tribes, and I will make them heads over you.'
     You answered me, and said, 'The thing which
    you have spoken is good to do.'  So I took the
    heads of your tribes, wise and respected men, and
    made them heads over you, captains of thousands,
    captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, captains
    of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.  I
    commanded your judges at that time, saying, 'Hear
    cases between your brothers and judge righteously
    between a man and his brother, and the foreigner
    who is living with him.  You shall not show
    partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and
    the great alike. You shall not be afraid of the face
    of man, for the judgment is God's. The case that
    is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I
    will hear it.'  I commanded you at that time all
    the things which you should do.  We traveled
    from Horeb and went through all that great and
    terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to
    the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God
    commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea.  I
    said to you, 'You have come to the hill country of
    the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us.
     Behold, Yahweh your God has set the land before
    you. Go up, take possession, as Yahweh the God
    of your fathers has spoken to you. Don't be afraid,
    neither be dismayed.'
    You came near to me, everyone of you, and said,
    'Let's send men before us, that they may search the
    land for us, and bring back to us word of the way
    by which we must go up, and the cities to which we
    shall come.'
    The thing pleased me well. I took twelve of your
    men, one man for every tribe.  They turned and
    went up into the hill country, and came to the valley
    of Eshcol, and spied it out.  They took some of the
    fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down
    to us, and brought us word again, and said, 'It is a
    good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.'
     Yet you wouldn't go up, but rebelled against
    the commandment of Yahweh your God.  You
    murmured in your tents, and said, 'Because Yahweh
    hated us, he has brought us out of the land of
    Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to
    destroy us.  Where are we going up? Our brothers
    have made our heart melt, saying, 'The people are
    greater and taller than we. The cities are great and
    fortified up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the
    sons of the Anakim there!' '
     Then I said to you, 'Don't be terrified. Don't
    be afraid of them.  Yahweh your God, who goes
    before you, he will fight for you, according to all
    that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,  and
    in the wilderness where you have seen how that
    Yahweh your God carried you, as a man carries his
    son, in all the way that you went, until you came to
    this place.'
     Yet in this thing you didn't believe Yahweh
    your God,  who went before you on the way, to
    seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in: in
    fire by night, to show you by what way you should
    go, and in the cloud by day.  Yahweh heard the
    voice of your words and was angry, and swore,
    saying,  'Surely not one of these men of this evil
    generation shall see the good land which I swore
    to give to your fathers,  except Caleb the son of
    Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the land
    that he has trodden on to him and to his children,
    because he has wholly followed Yahweh.'
    Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes,
    saying, 'You also shall not go in there.  Joshua the
    son of Nun, who stands before you,shall go in there.
    Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
     Moreover your little ones, whom you said would
    be captured or killed, your children, who today have
    no knowledge of good or evil,shall go in there. I will
    give it to them, and they shall possess it. But as for
    you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness
    by the way to the Red Sea.'
     Then you answered and said to me, 'We have
    sinned against Yahweh. We will go up and fight,

      
    according to all that Yahweh our God commanded
    us.' Every man of you put on his weapons of war,
    and presumed to go up into the hill country.
     Yahweh said to me, 'Tell them, 'Don't go up
    and don't fight; for I am not among you, lest you
    be struck before your enemies.' '
     So I spoke to you, and you didn't listen; but
    you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh,
    and were presumptuous, and went up into the
    hill country.  The Amorites, who lived in that
    hill country, came out against you and chased you
    as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to
    Hormah.  You returned and wept before Yahweh,
    but Yahweh didn't listen to your voice, nor turn his
    ear to you.  So you stayed in Kadesh many days,
    according to the days that you remained.
    
     Then we turned, and took our journey into the
    wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Yahweh
    spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many
    days.
     Yahweh spoke to me, saying,  'You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward.
     Command the people, saying, 'You are to pass
    through the border of your brothers, the children
    of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid
    of you. Therefore be careful.  Don't contend with
    them; for I will not give you any of their land, no,
    not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread
    on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a
    possession. You shall purchase food from them for
    money, that you may eat. You shall also buy water
    from them for money, that you may drink.' '
     For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the
    work of your hands. He has known your walking
    through this great wilderness. These forty years,
    Yahweh your God has been with you. You have
    lacked nothing.
     So we passed by from our brothers, the children
    of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the
    Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned
    and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
    Yahweh said to me, 'Don't bother Moab, neither
    contend with them in battle; for I will not give you
    any of his land for a possession, because I have given
    Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.'
     (The Emim lived there before, a great and
    numerous people, and tall as the Anakim.  These
    also are considered to be Rephaim, as the Anakim;
    but the Moabites call them Emim.  The Horites
    also lived in Seirin the past, but the children of Esau
    succeeded them. They destroyed them from before
    them, and lived in their place, as Israel did to the
    land of his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.)
     'Now rise up and cross over the brook Zered.'
    We went over the brook Zered.
    The daysin which we came from Kadesh Barnea
    until we had come over the brook Zered were thirty eight years, until all the generation of the men of
    war were consumed from the middle of the camp,
    as Yahweh swore to them.  Moreover Yahweh's
    hand was against them, to destroy them from the
    middle of the camp, until they were consumed.
     So, when all the men of war were consumed and
    dead from among the people,  Yahweh spoke to
    me, saying,  'You are to pass over Ar, the border
    of Moab, today.  When you come near the border
    of the children of Ammon, don't bother them, nor
    contend with them; for I will not give you any of
    the land of the children of Ammon for a possession,
    because I have given it to the children of Lot for a
    possession.'
     (That also is considered a land of Rephaim.
    Rephaim lived there in the past, but the Ammonites
    call them Zamzummim,  a great people, many, and
    tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them
    from before Israel, and they succeeded them, and
    lived in their place,  as he did for the children
    of Esau who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the
    Horites from before them; and they succeeded
    them, and lived in their place even to this day.
     Then the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as
    Gaza: the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor,
    destroyed them and lived in their place.)
     'Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the
    valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your
    hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his
    land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in
    battle.  Today I will begin to put the dread of you
    and the fear of you on the peoples who are under
    the whole sky, who shall hearthe report of you, and
    shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.'
     I sent messengers out of the wilderness of
    Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of
    peace, saying,  'Let me pass through your land. I
    will go along by the highway. I will turn neither
    to the right hand nor to the left.  You shall sell
    me food for money, that I may eat; and give me
    water for money, that I may drink. Just let me pass
    through on my feet,  as the children of Esau who
    dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar,
    did to me, until I pass over the Jordan into the land
    which Yahweh our God gives us.'  But Sihon king
    ofHeshbon would notlet us pass by him, forYahweh
    your God hardened his spirit and made his heart
    obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand,
    as it is today.
     Yahweh said to me, 'Behold, I have begun to
    deliver up Sihon and his land before you. Begin to
    possess, that you may inherit his land.'  Then
    Sihon came out against us, he and all his people,
    to battle at Jahaz.  Yahweh our God delivered
    him up before us; and we struck him, his sons,
    and all his people.  We took all his cities at that
    time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city,
    with the women and the little ones. We left no
    one remaining.  Only the livestock we took for
    plunderfor ourselves, with the plunder of the cities
    which we had taken.  From Aroer, which is on
    the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city
    that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not
    a city too high for us. Yahweh our God delivered up
    all before us.  Only to the land of the children of
    Ammon you didn't come near: all the banks of the
    river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and
    wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.
      
    
    Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan.
    Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and
    all his people, to battle at Edrei.  Yahweh said to
    me, 'Don't fear him; for I have delivered him, with
    all his people and his land, into your hand. You shall
    do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,
    who lived at Heshbon.'
     So Yahweh our God also delivered into our hand
    Og, the king of Bashan, and all his people. We struck
    him until no one was left to him remaining.  We
    took all his cities at that time. There was not a city
    which we didn't take from them: sixty cities, all
    the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
     All these were cities fortified with high walls,
    gates, and bars, in addition to a great many villages
    without walls.  We utterly destroyed them, as we
    did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying
    every inhabited city, with the women and the little
    ones.  But all the livestock, and the plunder of the
    cities, we took for plunder for ourselves.  We took
    the land atthattime out of the hand of the two kings
    of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from
    the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon.  (The
    Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call
    it Senir.) We took all the cities of the plain, and all
    Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of
    the kingdom of Og in Bashan.  (For only Og king of
    Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim.
    Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron. Isn't it
    in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits*
    was its length, and four cubits its width, after the
    cubit of a man.)  This land we took in possession
    at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley
    of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead
    with its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the
    Gadites;  and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the
    kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh
    -all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The
    same is called the land of Rephaim.  Jairthe son of
    Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border
    of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called
    them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth
    Jair, to this day.)  I gave Gilead to Machir.  To
    the Reubenites and to the GaditesI gave from Gilead
    even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the
    valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok,
    which isthe border of the children of Ammon;  the
    Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from
    Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt
    Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.
     I commanded you at that time, saying, 'Yahweh your God has given you this land to possess
    it. All of you men of valor shall pass over armed
    before your brothers, the children of Israel.  But
    your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock,
    (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in
    your cities which I have given you,  until Yahweh
    gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also
    possessthe land which Yahweh your God givesthem
    beyond the Jordan. Then you shall each return to
    his own possession, which I have given you.'
     I commanded Joshua atthattime,saying, 'Your
    eyes have seen all that Yahweh your God has done
    to these two kings. So shall Yahweh do to all the
    kingdoms where you go over.  You shall not fear
    them; for Yahweh your God himself fights for you.'
     I begged Yahweh at that time, saying,  'Lord
    Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your
    greatness, and your strong hand. For what god is
    there in heaven or in earth that can do works like
    yours, and mighty acts like yours?  Please let me
    go over and see the good land that is beyond the
    Jordan, that fine mountain, and Lebanon.'
     But Yahweh was angry with me because of
    you, and didn't listen to me. Yahweh said to me,
    'That is enough! Speak no more to me of this
    matter. Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your
    eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and
    eastward, and see with your eyes; for you shall not
    go over this Jordan.  But commission Joshua, and
    encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go
    over before this people, and he shall cause them
    to inherit the land which you shall see.'  So we
    stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
    
     Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the
    ordinances which I teach you, to do them, that you
    may live and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, gives you.  You shall
    not add to the word which I command you, neither
    shall you take away from it, that you may keep
    the commandments of Yahweh your God which I
    command you.  Your eyes have seen what Yahweh
    did because of Baal Peor; for Yahweh your God
    has destroyed all the men who followed Baal Peor
    from among you.  But you who were faithful to
    Yahweh your God are all alive today.  Behold, I
    have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as
    Yahweh my God commanded me, that you should
    do so in the middle of the land where you go in
    to possess it.  Keep therefore and do them; for
    this is your wisdom and your understanding in the
    sight of the peoples who shall hear all these statutes
    and say, 'Surely this great nation is a wise and
    understanding people.'  For what great nation is
    there that has a god so near to them as Yahweh
    our God is whenever we call on him?  What great
    nation is there that has statutes and ordinances
    so righteous as all this law which I set before you
    today?
     Only be careful, and keep your soul diligently,
    lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and
    lest they depart from your heart all the days of your
    life; but make them known to your children and
    your children's children-  the day that you stood
    before Yahweh your God in Horeb, when Yahweh
    said to me, 'Assemble the people to me, and I will
    make them hear my words, that they may learn to
    fear me all the days that they live on the earth,
    and that they may teach their children.'  You
    came near and stood under the mountain. The
    * : A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man's arm,
    or about  inches or  centimeters.  
      
    mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky,
    with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. Yahweh
    spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you
    heard the voice of words, but you saw no form;
    you only heard a voice.  He declared to you his
    covenant, which he commanded you to perform,
    even the ten commandments. He wrote them on
    two stone tablets.  Yahweh commanded me at
    that time to teach you statutes and ordinances,
    that you might do them in the land where you go
    over to possess it.  Be very careful, for you saw
    no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to
    you in Horeb out of the middle of the fire,  lest
    you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself a carved
    image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male
    orfemale,  the likeness of any animalthatis on the
    earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in
    the sky,  the likeness of anything that creeps on
    the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the
    water under the earth;  and lest you lift up your
    eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the
    moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky,
    you are drawn away and worship them, and serve
    them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to all
    the peoples underthe whole sky.  But Yahweh has
    taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace,
    out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance,
    as it is today.  Furthermore Yahweh was angry
    with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not
    go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to
    that good land which Yahweh your God gives you
    for an inheritance;  but I must die in this land. I
    must not go over the Jordan, but you shall go over
    and possess that good land.  Be careful, lest you
    forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he
    made with you, and make yourselves a carved image
    in the form of anything which Yahweh your God
    has forbidden you.  For Yahweh your God is a
    devouring fire, a jealous God.  When you father
    children and children's children, and you have been
    long in the land, and then corrupt yourselves, and
    make a carved image in the form of anything, and
    do that which is evil in Yahweh your God's sight to
    provoke him to anger,  I call heaven and earth to
    witness against you today, that you willsoon utterly
    perish from off the land which you go over the
    Jordan to possess it. You will not prolong your days
    on it, but will utterly be destroyed.  Yahweh will
    scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left
    few in number among the nations where Yahweh
    will lead you away.  There you will serve gods,
    the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which
    neithersee, nor hear, nor eat, norsmell.  But from
    there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you will
    find him when you search after him with all your
    heart and with all your soul.  When you are in
    oppression, and all these things have come on you,
    in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your
    God and listen to his voice.  For Yahweh your God
    is a merciful God. He will not fail you nor destroy
    you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which
    he swore to them.  For ask now of the days that
    are past, which were before you, since the day that
    God created man on the earth, and from the one
    end of the sky to the other, whether there has been
    anything as great as this thing is, or has been heard
    like it?  Did a people ever hear the voice of God
    speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have
    heard, and live?  Or has God tried to go and take a
    nation for himself from among another nation, by
    trials, by signs, by wonders, by war, by a mighty
    hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors,
    according to all that Yahweh your God did for you
    in Egypt before your eyes?  It was shown to you
    so that you might know that Yahweh is God. There
    is no one else besides him.  Out of heaven he
    made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct
    you. On earth he made you to see his great fire;
    and you heard his words out of the middle of the
    fire.  Because he loved your fathers, therefore he
    chose their offspring after them, and brought you
    out with his presence, with his great power, out
    of Egypt;  to drive out nations from before you
    greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to
    give you their land for an inheritance, as it is today.
     Know therefore today, and take it to heart, that
    Yahweh himself is God in heaven above and on the
    earth beneath. There is no one else.  You shall
    keep his statutes and his commandments which I
    command you today, that it may go well with you
    and with your children after you, and that you may
    prolong your days in the land which Yahweh your
    God gives you for all time.
     Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the
    Jordan toward the sunrise,  that the man slayer
    might flee there, who kills his neighbor unintentionally and didn't hate him in time past, and that
    fleeing to one of these cities he might live:  Bezer
    in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the
    Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites;
    and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.
     This is the law which Moses set before the
    children of Israel.  These are the testimonies,
    and the statutes, and the ordinances which Moses
    spoke to the children of Israel when they came
    out of Egypt,  beyond the Jordan, in the valley
    opposite Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the
    Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and
    the children of Israel struck when they came out
    of Egypt.  They took possession of his land and
    the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the
    Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the
    sunrise;  from Aroer, which is on the edge of the
    valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Zion (also called
    Hermon),  and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan
    eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the
    slopes of Pisgah.
    
     Moses called to all Israel, and said to them,
    'Hear, Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which
    I speak in your ears today, that you may learn them,
    and observe to do them.'  Yahweh our God made
    a covenant with us in Horeb.  Yahweh didn't make
    this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us,
    who are all of us here alive today.  Yahweh spoke
    with you face to face on the mountain out of the
    middle of the fire,  (I stood between Yahweh and
      
    you at that time, to show you Yahweh's word; for
    you were afraid because of the fire, and didn't go up
    onto the mountain) saying,
     'I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of
    the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
     'You shall have no other gods before me.
     'You shall not make a carved image for yourself
    -any likeness of what isin heaven above, or what is
    in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under
    the earth.  You shall not bow yourself down to
    them, nor serve them, for I, Yahweh your God, am
    a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
    on the children and on the third and on the fourth
    generation of those who hate me  and showing
    loving kindness to thousands of those who love me
    and keep my commandments.
     'You shall not misuse the name of Yahweh your
    God;* for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who
    misuses his name.
     'Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as
    Yahweh your God commanded you.  You shall
    labor six days, and do all your work;  but the
    seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God, in
    which you shall not do any work - neither you,
    nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male
    servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor
    your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor your
    stranger who is within your gates; that your male
    servant and your female servant may rest as well
    as you.  You shall remember that you were a
    servant in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God
    brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by
    an outstretched arm. Therefore Yahweh your God
    commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
     'Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you, that your days may
    be long and that it may go well with you in the land
    which Yahweh your God gives you.
     'You shall not murder.
     'You shall not commit adultery.
     'You shall not steal.
     'You shall not give false testimony against your
    neighbor.
     'You shall not covet your neighbor's wife.
    Neither shall you desire your neighbor's house, his
    field, or his male servant, or his female servant,
    his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your
    neighbor's.'
    Yahweh spoke these words to all your assembly
    on the mountain out of the middle of the fire, of the
    cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice.
    He added no more. He wrote them on two stone
    tablets, and gave them to me.  When you heard
    the voice out of the middle of the darkness, while
    the mountain was burning with fire, you came near
    to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your
    elders;  and you said, 'Behold, Yahweh our God
    has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we
    have heard his voice out of the middle of the fire. We
    have seen today that God does speak with man, and
    he lives.  Now therefore, why should we die? For
    this great fire will consume us. If we hear Yahweh
    our God's voice any more, then we shall die.  For
    who is there of all flesh who has heard the voice
    of the living God speaking out of the middle of the
    fire, as we have, and lived?  Go near, and hear all
    that Yahweh our God shall say, and tell us all that
    Yahweh our God tells you; and we will hear it, and
    do it.'
     Yahweh heard the voice of your words when
    you spoke to me; and Yahweh said to me, 'I have
    heard the voice of the words of this people which
    they have spoken to you. They have well said all
    that they have spoken.  Oh that there were such
    a heart in them that they would fear me and keep
    all my commandments always, that it might be well
    with them and with their children forever!
     'Go tell them, 'Return to your tents.'  But
    as for you, stand here by me, and I will tell you
    all the commandments, and the statutes, and the
    ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they
    may do them in the land which I give them to
    possess.'
     You shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh
    your God has commanded you. You shall not turn
    away to the right hand or to the left.  You shall
    walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has
    commanded you, that you may live and that it may
    be well with you, and that you may prolong your
    days in the land which you shall possess.
    
    Now these are the commandments, the statutes,
    and the ordinances, which Yahweh your God commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the
    land that you go over to possess;  that you might
    fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes and
    his commandments, which I command you-you,
    your son, and your son's son, all the days of your
    life; and that your days may be prolonged.  Hear
    therefore, Israel, and observe to do it, that it may be
    well with you, and that you may increase mightily,
    as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to
    you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.
     Hear, Israel: Yahweh is our God. Yahweh is
    one.  You shall love Yahweh your God with all your
    heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.
     These words, which I command you today, shall be
    on your heart;  and you shall teach them diligently
    to your children, and shall talk of them when you
    sit in your house, and when you walk by the way,
    and when you lie down, and when you rise up. You
    shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they
    shall be for frontlets between your eyes.  You shall
    write them on the door posts of your house and on
    your gates.
     It shall be, when Yahweh your God brings you
    into the land which he swore to your fathers, to
    Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great
    and goodly cities which you didn't build,  and
    houses full of all good things which you didn't fill,
    and cisterns dug out which you didn't dig, vineyards
    and olive trees which you didn't plant, and you
    shall eat and be full;  then beware lest you forget
    Yahweh, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,

      
    out of the house of bondage.  You shall fear
    Yahweh your God; and you shall serve him, and shall
    swear by his name.  You shall not go after other
    gods, of the gods of the peoples who are around
    you,  for Yahweh your God among you is a jealous
    God, lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled
    against you, and he destroy you from off the face
    of the earth.  You shall not tempt Yahweh your
    God, as you tempted him in Massah.  You shall
    diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your
    God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he
    has commanded you.  You shall do that which is
    right and good in Yahweh's sight, that it may be
    well with you and that you may go in and possess
    the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers,
     to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as
    Yahweh has spoken.
     When your son asks you in time to come, saying, 'What do the testimonies, the statutes, and the
    ordinances, whichYahweh our God has commanded
    you mean?'  then you shall tell your son, 'We
    were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt. Yahweh brought
    us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;  and Yahweh
    showed great and awesome signs and wonders on
    Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our
    eyes;  and he brought us out from there, that he
    might bring us in, to give us the land which he
    swore to our fathers.  Yahweh commanded us to
    do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God, for
    our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as
    we are today.  It shall be righteousness to us, if
    we observe to do all these commandments before
    Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us.'
    
     When Yahweh your God brings you into the
    land where you go to possess it, and casts out many
    nations before you-the Hittite, the Girgashite, the
    Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite,
    and the Jebusite-seven nations greater and mightier than you;  and when Yahweh your God delivers
    them up before you, and you strike them, then
    you shall utterly destroy them. You shall make no
    covenant with them, norshow mercy to them. You
    shall not make marriages with them. You shall not
    give your daughter to his son, nor shall you take his
    daughter for your son.  For that would turn away
    your sons from following me, that they may serve
    other gods. So Yahweh's anger would be kindled
    against you, and he would destroy you quickly. But
    you shall deal with them like this: you shall break
    down their altars, dash their pillars in pieces, cut
    down their Asherah poles, and burn their engraved
    images with fire.  For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God. Yahweh your God has chosen you to
    be a people for his own possession, above all peoples
    who are on the face of the earth. Yahweh didn't set
    his love on you nor choose you, because you were
    more in number than any people; for you were the
    fewest of all peoples;  but because Yahweh loves
    you, and because he desires to keep the oath which
    he swore to your fathers, Yahweh has brought you
    out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the
    house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king
    of Egypt.  Know therefore that Yahweh your God
    himself is God,the faithful God, who keeps covenant
    and loving kindness to a thousand generations with
    those who love him and keep his commandments,
     and repays those who hate him to their face, to
    destroy them. He will not be slack to him who hates
    him. He will repay him to his face.  You shall
    therefore keep the commandments, the statutes,
    and the ordinances which I command you today,
    to do them.  It shall happen, because you listen
    to these ordinances and keep and do them, that
    Yahweh your God will keep with you the covenant
    and the loving kindness which he swore to your
    fathers.  He will love you, bless you, and multiply
    you. He will also bless the fruit of your body and the
    fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine
    and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the
    young of your flock, in the land which he swore to
    your fathers to give you. You will be blessed above
    all peoples. There won't be male or female barren
    among you, or among your livestock.  Yahweh
    will take away from you all sickness; and he will put
    none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know,
    on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you.
     You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh
    your God shall deliver to you. Your eye shall not
    pity them. You shall not serve their gods; for that
    would be a snare to you.  If you shall say in your
    heart, 'These nations are more than I; how can I
    dispossess them?' you shall not be afraid of them.
    You shall remember well what Yahweh your God did
    to Pharaoh and to all Egypt:  the great trials which
    your eyes saw, the signs, the wonders, the mighty
    hand, and the outstretched arm, by which Yahweh
    your God brought you out. So shall Yahweh your
    God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
     Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet
    among them, until those who are left, and hide
    themselves, perish from before you. You shall not
    be scared of them; for Yahweh your God is among
    you, a great and awesome God.  Yahweh your
    God will cast out those nations before you little by
    little. You may not consume them at once, lest the
    animals of the field increase on you.  But Yahweh
    your God will deliver them up before you, and will
    confuse them with a great confusion, until they are
    destroyed.  He will deliver their kings into your
    hand, and you shall make their name perish from
    under the sky. No one will be able to stand before
    you until you have destroyed them.  You shall
    burn the engraved images of their gods with fire.
    You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on
    them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared
    in it; for it is an abomination to Yahweh your God.
     You shall not bring an abomination into your
    house and become a devoted thing like it. You shall
    utterly detest it. You shall utterly abhor it; for it is
    a devoted thing.
    
     You shall observe to do all the commandments
    which I command you today, that you may live, and
    multiply, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers.  You shall remember
      
    all the way which Yahweh your God has led you
    these forty years in the wilderness, that he might
    humble you, to test you, to know what was in your
    heart, whether you would keep his commandments
    or not. He humbled you, allowed you to be hungry,
    and fed you with manna, which you didn't know,
    neither did your fathers know, that he might teach
    you that man does not live by bread only, but man
    lives by every word that proceeds out of Yahweh's
    mouth.  Your clothing didn't grow old on you,
    neither did your foot swell, these forty years.  You
    shall consider in your heart that as a man disciplines
    his son, so Yahweh your God disciplines you.  You
    shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God,
    to walk in his ways, and to fear him.  For Yahweh
    your God brings you into a good land, a land of
    brooks of water, of springs, and underground water
    flowing into valleys and hills;  a land of wheat,
    barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of
    olive trees and honey;  a land in which you shall eat
    bread without scarcity, you shall not lack anything
    in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose
    hills you may dig copper. You shall eat and be full,
    and you shall bless Yahweh your God for the good
    land which he has given you.
    Beware lest you forget Yahweh your God, in not
    keeping his commandments, his ordinances, and
    his statutes, which I command you today;  lest,
    when you have eaten and are full, and have built
    fine houses and lived in them;  and when your
    herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and
    your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is
    multiplied;  then your heart might be lifted up,
    and you forget Yahweh your God, who brought you
    out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;
     who led you through the great and terrible
    wilderness, with venomous snakes and scorpions,
    and thirsty ground where there was no water; who
    poured water for you out of the rock of flint;  who
    fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your
    fathers didn't know, that he might humble you, and
    that he might prove you, to do you good at your
    latter end;  and lest you say in your heart, 'My
    power and the might of my hand has gotten me this
    wealth.'  But you shall remember Yahweh your
    God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth,
    that he may establish his covenant which he swore
    to your fathers, as it is today.
     It shall be, if you shall forget Yahweh your
    God, and walk after other gods, and serve them and
    worship them, I testify against you today that you
    shall surely perish.  As the nations that Yahweh
    makes to perish before you, so you shall perish,
    because you wouldn't listen to Yahweh your God's
    voice.
    
     Hear, Israel! You are to pass over the Jordan
    today, to go in to dispossess nations greater and
    mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up
    to the sky,  a people great and tall, the sons of
    the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you
    have heard say, 'Who can stand before the sons of
    Anak?'  Know therefore today that Yahweh your
    God is he who goes over before you as a devouring
    fire. He will destroy them and he will bring them
    down before you. So you shall drive them out and
    make them perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to
    you.
     Don't say in your heart, after Yahweh your
    God has thrust them out from before you, 'For my
    righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess
    this land;' because Yahweh drives them out before
    you because of the wickedness of these nations.
     Not for your righteousness or for the uprightness
    of your heart do you go in to possess their land;
    but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh
    your God does drive them out from before you,
    and that he may establish the word which Yahweh
    swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and
    to Jacob.  Know therefore that Yahweh your God
    doesn't give you this good land to possess for your
    righteousness, for you are a stiff-necked people.
     Remember, and don't forget, how you provoked
    Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness. From
    the day that you left the land of Egypt until you
    came to this place, you have been rebellious against
    Yahweh.  Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to
    wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy
    you.  When I had gone up onto the mountain
    to receive the stone tablets, even the tablets of
    the covenant which Yahweh made with you, then I
    stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
    I neither ate bread nor drank water.  Yahweh
    delivered to me the two stone tablets written with
    God's finger. On them were all the words which
    Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the
    middle of the fire in the day of the assembly.
     It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty
    nights that Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets,
    even the tablets of the covenant.  Yahweh said to
    me, 'Arise, get down quickly from here; for your
    people whom you have brought out of Egypt have
    corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned
    away from the way which I commanded them. They
    have made a molten image for themselves!'
     Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, 'I
    have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people. Leave me alone,thatI may destroy
    them, and blot out their name from under the sky;
    and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater
    than they.'
     So I turned and came down from the mountain,
    and the mountain was burning with fire. The two
    tablets of the covenant were in my two hands.  I
    looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh
    your God. You had made yourselves a molded calf.
    You had quickly turned away from the way which
    Yahweh had commanded you.  I took hold of
    the two tablets, and threw them out of my two
    hands, and broke them before your eyes.  I fell
    down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and
    forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water,
    because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing
    that which was evil in Yahweh's sight, to provoke
    him to anger.  ForI was afraid of the anger and hot
    displeasure with which Yahweh was angry against
    you to destroy you. But Yahweh listened to me that
      
    time also.  Yahweh was angry enough with Aaron
    to destroy him. I prayed for Aaron also at the same
    time.  I took your sin,the calf which you had made,
    and burned it with fire, and crushed it, grinding
    it very small, until it was as fine as dust. I threw
    its dust into the brook that descended out of the
    mountain.  At Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth
    Hattaavah you provoked Yahweh to wrath.  When
    Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, 'Go
    up and possess the land which I have given you,'
    you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh
    your God, and you didn't believe him orlisten to his
    voice.  You have been rebellious against Yahweh
    from the day thatI knew you. So I fell down before
    Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell
    down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy
    you.  I prayed to Yahweh, and said, 'Lord Yahweh,
    don't destroy your people and your inheritance that
    you have redeemed through your greatness, that
    you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
     Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and
    Jacob. Don't look at the stubbornness of this people,
    nor at their wickedness, nor at their sin,  lest
    the land you brought us out from say, 'Because
    Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land
    which he promised to them, and because he hated
    them, he has brought them out to kill them in the
    wilderness.'  Yet they are your people and your
    inheritance, which you brought out by your great
    power and by your outstretched arm.'
    
     At that time Yahweh said to me, 'Cut two stone
    tablets like the first, and come up to me onto the
    mountain, and make an ark of wood.  I will write on
    the tablets the words that were on the first tablets
    which you broke, and you shall put them in the
    ark.'  So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut
    two stone tablets like the first, and went up onto the
    mountain, having the two tablets in my hand.  He
    wrote on the tablets, according to the first writing,
    the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to
    you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in
    the day of the assembly; and Yahweh gave them to
    me.  I turned and came down from the mountain,
    and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and
    there they are as Yahweh commanded me.
     (The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth
    Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and
    there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered
    in the priest's office in his place.  From there
    they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to
    Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.  At that time
    Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi to bear the ark
    of Yahweh's covenant, to stand before Yahweh to
    minister to him, and to bless in his name,to this day.
    Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with
    his brothers; Yahweh is his inheritance, according
    as Yahweh your God spoke to him.)
     I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time,
    forty days and forty nights; and Yahweh listened
    to me that time also. Yahweh would not destroy
    you. Yahweh said to me, 'Arise, take your journey
    before the people; and they shall go in and possess
    the land which I swore to their fathers to give to
    them.'
     Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require of you, but to fear Yahweh your God,to walk in
    all his ways, to love him, and to serve Yahweh your
    God with all your heart and with all your soul,  to
    keep Yahweh's commandments and statutes, which
    I command you today for your good?  Behold,
    to Yahweh your God belongs heaven, the heaven
    of heavens, and the earth, with all that is therein.
     Only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love
    them, and he chose their offspring after them, even
    you above all peoples, as it is today.  Circumcise
    therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more
    stiff-necked.  For Yahweh your God, he is God of
    gods and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty,
    and the awesome, who doesn't respect persons or
    take bribes. He executes justice for the fatherless
    and widow and loves the foreigner in giving him
    food and clothing.  Therefore love the foreigner,
    for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.  You
    shall fear Yahweh your God. You shall serve him.
    You shall cling to him, and you shall swear by his
    name.  He is your praise, and he is your God, who
    has done for you these great and awesome things
    which your eyes have seen.  Your fathers went
    down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now
    Yahweh your God has made you as the stars of the
    sky for multitude.
    
     Therefore you shall love Yahweh your God, and
    keep his instructions, his statutes, his ordinances,
    and his commandments, always.  Know this day-
    for I don't speak with your children who have not
    known, and who have not seen the chastisement of
    Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand,
    his outstretched arm,  his signs, and his works,
    which he did in the middle of Egypt to Pharaoh
    the king of Egypt, and to all his land;  and what
    he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and
    to their chariots; how he made the water of the
    Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued you,
    and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day;
     and what he did to you in the wilderness until you
    came to this place;  and what he did to Dathan and
    Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben-how
    the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up,
    with their households, their tents, and every living
    thing that followed them, in the middle of all Israel;
     but your eyes have seen all of Yahweh's great work
    which he did.
     Therefore you shall keep the entire commandment which I command you today, that you may
    be strong, and go in and possess the land that you
    go over to possess;  and that you may prolong
    your days in the land which Yahweh swore to your
    fathers to give to them and to their offspring, a
    land flowing with milk and honey.  For the land,
    where you go in to possess isn't like the land of
    Egypt that you came out of, where you sowed your
    seed and watered it with your foot, as a garden of
    herbs;  but the land that you go over to possess
    is a land of hills and valleys which drinks water
      
    from the rain of the sky,  a land which Yahweh
    your God cares for. Yahweh your God's eyes are
    always on it, from the beginning of the year even
    to the end of the year.  It shall happen, if you
    shall listen diligently to my commandments which
    I command you today, to love Yahweh your God,
    and to serve him with all your heart and with all
    your soul,  that I will give the rain for your land
    in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that
    you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and
    your oil.  I will give grass in your fields for your
    livestock, and you shall eat and be full.  Be careful,
    lest your heart be deceived, and you turn away to
    serve other gods and worship them;  and Yahweh's
    anger be kindled against you, and he shut up the sky
    so that there is no rain, and the land doesn't yield its
    fruit; and you perish quickly from off the good land
    which Yahweh gives you.  Therefore you shall lay
    up these words of mine in your heart and in your
    soul. You shall bind them for a sign on your hand,
    and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
     You shall teach them to your children, talking of
    them when you sit in your house, when you walk
    by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise
    up.  You shall write them on the door posts of
    your house and on your gates;  that your days and
    your children's days may be multiplied in the land
    which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them,
    as the days of the heavens above the earth.  For if
    you shall diligently keep all these commandments
    which I command you-to do them, to love Yahweh
    your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him
    -  then Yahweh will drive out all these nations
    from before you, and you shall dispossess nations
    greater and mightier than yourselves. Every place
    on which the sole of your foot treads shall be yours:
    from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river,
    the river Euphrates, even to the western sea shall be
    your border.  No man will be able to stand before
    you. Yahweh your God will lay the fear of you and
    the dread of you on all the land that you tread on,
    as he has spoken to you.  Behold, I set before you
    today a blessing and a curse:  the blessing, if you
    listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God,
    which I command you today;  and the curse, if you
    do not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your
    God, but turn away out of the way which I command
    you today, to go after other gods which you have
    not known.  It shall happen, when Yahweh your
    God brings you into the land that you go to possess,
    that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim,
    and the curse on Mount Ebal.  Aren't they beyond
    the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the
    sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the
    Arabah near Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?  For
    you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess
    the land which Yahweh your God gives you, and you
    shall possess it and dwell in it.  You shall observe
    to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set
    before you today.
    
    These are the statutes and the ordinances which
    you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh,
    the God of your fathers, has given you to possess
    all the days that you live on the earth.  You shall
    surely destroy all the places in which the nations
    that you shall dispossess served their gods: on the
    high mountains, and on the hills, and under every
    green tree. You shall break down their altars, dash
    their pillars in pieces, and burn their Asherah poles
    with fire. You shall cut down the engraved images
    of their gods. You shall destroy their name out of
    that place.  You shall not do so to Yahweh your
    God.  But to the place which Yahweh your God
    shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name
    there, you shall seek his habitation, and you shall
    come there.  You shall bring your burnt offerings,
    your sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of
    your hand, your vows, your free will offerings, and
    the firstborn of your herd and of your flock there.
     There you shall eat before Yahweh your God, and
    you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to,
    you and your households, in which Yahweh your
    God has blessed you.  You shall not do all the
    things that we do here today, every man whatever
    is right in his own eyes;  for you haven't yet come
    to the rest and to the inheritance which Yahweh
    your God gives you.  But when you go over the
    Jordan and dwell in the land which Yahweh your
    God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest
    from all your enemies around you, so that you
    dwell in safety,  then it shall happen that to the
    place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause
    his name to dwell there, there you shall bring all
    that I command you: your burnt offerings, your
    sacrifices, your tithes, the wave offering of your
    hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to
    Yahweh.  You shall rejoice before Yahweh your
    God-you, and your sons, your daughters, your male
    servants, your female servants, and the Levite who
    is within your gates, because he has no portion nor
    inheritance with you.  Be careful that you don't
    offer your burnt offerings in every place that you
    see;  but in the place which Yahweh chooses in
    one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt
    offerings, and there you shall do all that I command
    you.
     Yet you may kill and eat meat within all your
    gates, after all the desire of your soul, according
    to Yahweh your God's blessing which he has given
    you. The unclean and the clean may eat of it, as
    of the gazelle and the deer.  Only you shall not
    eat the blood. You shall pour it out on the earth
    like water.  You may not eat within your gates the
    tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your
    oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock,
    nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your free
    will offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand;
     but you shall eat them before Yahweh your God in
    the place which Yahweh your God shall choose: you,
    your son, your daughter, your male servant, your
    female servant, and the Levite who is within your
    gates. You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God in
    all that you put your hand to.  Be careful that you
    don't forsake the Levite as long as you live in your
    land.
     When Yahweh your God enlarges your border,
      
    as he has promised you, and you say, 'I want to eat
    meat,' because your soul desires to eat meat, you
    may eat meat, after all the desire of your soul.  If
    the place which Yahweh your God shall choose to
    put his name is too far from you, then you shall kill
    of your herd and of your flock, which Yahweh has
    given you, as I have commanded you; and you may
    eat within your gates, after all the desire of your
    soul.  Even as the gazelle and as the deer is eaten,
    so you shall eat of it. The unclean and the clean
    may eat of it alike.  Only be sure that you don't
    eat the blood; for the blood is the life. You shall not
    eat the life with the meat.  You shall not eat it.
    You shall pour it out on the earth like water.  You
    shall not eat it,that it may go well with you and with
    your children after you, when you do that which
    is right in Yahweh's eyes.  Only your holy things
    which you have, and your vows, you shall take and
    go to the place which Yahweh shall choose.  You
    shall offer your burnt offerings, the meat and the
    blood, on Yahweh your God's altar. The blood of
    your sacrifices shall be poured out on Yahweh your
    God's altar, and you shall eat the meat.  Observe
    and hear all these words which I command you, that
    it may go well with you and with your children after
    you forever, when you do that which is good and
    right in Yahweh your God's eyes.
     When Yahweh your God cuts off the nations
    from before you where you go in to dispossess them,
    and you dispossess them and dwell in their land,
     be careful that you are not ensnared to follow
    them after they are destroyed from before you,
    and that you not inquire after their gods, saying,
    'How do these nations serve their gods? I will do
    likewise.' You shall not do so to Yahweh your God;
    for every abomination to Yahweh, which he hates,
    they have done to their gods; for they even burn
    their sons and their daughters in the fire to their
    gods.  Whatever thing I command you, that you
    shall observe to do. You shall not add to it, nor take
    away from it.
    
     If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises
    among you, and he gives you a sign or a wonder,
     and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which
    he spoke to you, saying, 'Let's go after other gods'
    (which you have not known) 'and let'sserve them,'
     you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or
    to that dreamer of dreams; for Yahweh your God is
    testing you, to know whether you love Yahweh your
    God with all your heart and with all your soul. You
    shall walk after Yahweh your God, fear him, keep
    his commandments, and obey his voice. You shall
    serve him, and cling to him.  That prophet, or that
    dreamer of dreams,shall be put to death, because he
    has spoken rebellion against Yahweh your God, who
    brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed
    you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside
    out of the way which Yahweh your God commanded
    you to walk in. So you shall remove the evil from
    among you.
     If your brother, the son of your mother, or your
    son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom,
    or your friend who is as your own soul, entices you
    secretly, saying, 'Let's go and serve other gods'-
    which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;
     of the gods of the peoples who are around you,
    near to you, or far off from you, from the one end of
    the earth even to the other end of the earth-  you
    shall not consent to him nor listen to him; neither
    shall your eye pity him, neither shall you spare,
    neither shall you conceal him;  but you shall surely
    kill him. Your hand shall be first on him to put him
    to death, and afterwards the hands of all the people.
    You shall stone him to death with stones, because
    he has sought to draw you away from Yahweh your
    God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out
    of the house of bondage.  All Israel shall hear, and
    fear, and shall not do any more wickedness like this
    among you.
     If you hear about one of your cities, which
    Yahweh your God gives you to dwell there, that
     certain wicked fellows have gone out from among
    you and have drawn away the inhabitants of their
    city, saying, 'Let's go and serve other gods,' which
    you have not known,  then you shall inquire, investigate, and ask diligently. Behold, if it is true, and
    the thing certain, that such abomination was done
    among you,  you shall surely strike the inhabitants
    of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying
    it utterly, with all that is therein and its livestock,
    with the edge of the sword.  You shall gather all
    its plunder into the middle of its street, and shall
    burn with fire the city, with all of its plunder, to
    Yahweh your God. It shall be a heap forever. It
    shall not be built again.  Nothing of the devoted
    thing shall cling to your hand, that Yahweh may
    turn from the fierceness of his anger and show you
    mercy, and have compassion on you and multiply
    you, as he has sworn to your fathers,  when you
    listen to Yahweh your God's voice, to keep all his
    commandments which I command you today, to do
    that which is right in Yahweh your God's eyes.
    
     You are the children of Yahweh your God. You
    shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness
    between your eyes for the dead.  For you are a holy
    people to Yahweh your God, and Yahweh has chosen
    you to be a people for his own possession, above all
    peoples who are on the face of the earth.
     You shall not eat any abominable thing.  These
    are the animals which you may eat: the ox, the
    sheep, the goat,  the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck,
    the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, and the
    chamois.   Every animal that parts the hoof, and has
    the hoof split in two and chews the cud, among the
    animals, you may eat. Neverthelessthese you shall
    not eat of them that chew the cud, or of those who
    have the hoof split: the camel, the hare, and the
    rabbit. Because they chew the cud but don't part the
    hoof, they are unclean to you.  The pig, because it
    has a split hoof but doesn't chew the cud, is unclean
    to you. You shall not eat their meat. You shall not
    touch their carcasses. These you may eat of all that
    are in the waters: you may eat whatever has fins
    and scales.  You shall not eat whatever doesn't
      
    have fins and scales. It is unclean to you.  Of all
    clean birds you may eat.  But these are they of
    which you shall not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the
    osprey,  the red kite, the falcon, the kite of any
    kind,  every raven of any kind,  the ostrich, the
    owl, the seagull, the hawk of any kind,  the little
    owl, the great owl, the horned owl,  the pelican,
    the vulture, the cormorant,  the stork, the heron
    after its kind, the hoopoe, and the bat. All winged
    creeping things are unclean to you. They shall not
    be eaten.  Of all clean birds you may eat.
     You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself.
    You may give it to the foreigner living among you
    who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you
    may sell it to a foreigner; for you are a holy people
    to Yahweh your God.
    You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's
    milk.
     You shall surely tithe all the increase of your
    seed, that which comes out of the field year by year.
     You shall eat before Yahweh your God, in the
    place which he chooses to cause his name to dwell,
    the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of
    your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and of your
    flock; that you may learn to fear Yahweh your God
    always.  If the way is too long for you, so that
    you are not able to carry it because the place which
    Yahweh your God shall choose to set his name there
    is too far from you, when Yahweh your God blesses
    you,  then you shall turn it into money, bind up
    the money in your hand, and shall go to the place
    which Yahweh your God shall choose.  You shall
    trade the money for whatever your soul desires: for
    cattle, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink,
    or for whatever your soul asks of you. You shall
    eat there before Yahweh your God, and you shall
    rejoice, you and your household.  You shall not
    forsake the Levite who is within your gates, for he
    has no portion nor inheritance with you.  At the
    end of every three years you shall bring all the tithe
    of your increase in the same year, and shall store
    it within your gates.  The Levite, because he has
    no portion nor inheritance with you, as well as the
    foreigner living among you, the fatherless, and the
    widow who are within your gates shall come, and
    shall eat and be satisfied; thatYahweh your God may
    bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.
    
    At the end of every seven years, you shall cancel
    debts.  This is the way it shall be done: every
    creditor shall release that which he has lent to his
    neighbor. He shall not require payment from his
    neighbor and his brother, because Yahweh's release
    has been proclaimed.  Of a foreigner you may require it; but whatever of yours is with your brother,
    your hand shall release.  However there will be
    no poor with you (for Yahweh will surely bless you
    in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for
    an inheritance to possess)  if only you diligently
    listen to Yahweh your God's voice, to observe to do
    all this commandment which I command you today.
    For Yahweh your God will bless you, as he promised
    you. You will lend to many nations, but you will
    not borrow. You will rule over many nations, but
    they will not rule over you.  If a poor man, one
    of your brothers, is with you within any of your
    gates in your land which Yahweh your God gives
    you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your
    hand from your poor brother;  but you shall surely
    open your hand to him, and shall surely lend him
    sufficient for his need, which he lacks. Beware that
    there not be a wicked thought in your heart,saying,
    'The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand,'
    and your eye be evil against your poor brother and
    you give him nothing; and he cry to Yahweh against
    you, and it be sin to you.  You shall surely give,
    and your heart shall not be grieved when you give
    to him, because it is for this thing Yahweh your God
    will bless you in all your work and in all that you put
    your hand to.  For the poor will never cease out of
    the land. Therefore I command you to surely open
    your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to
    your poor, in your land.  If your brother, a Hebrew
    man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you and serves
    you six years, then in the seventh year you shall let
    him go free from you.  When you let him go free
    from you, you shall not let him go empty.  You
    shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of
    your threshing floor, and out of your wine press. As
    Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall give to
    him.  You shall remember that you were a slave in
    the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed
    you. Therefore I command you this thing today.  It
    shall be, if he tells you, 'I will not go out from you,'
    because he loves you and your house, because he
    is well with you,  then you shall take an awl, and
    thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be
    your servant forever. Also to your female servant
    you shall do likewise.  It shall not seem hard to you
    when you let him go free from you, for he has been
    double the value of a hired hand as he served you six
    years. Yahweh your God will bless you in all that you
    do.  You shall dedicate all the firstborn males that
    are born of your herd and of your flock to Yahweh
    your God. You shall do no work with the firstborn
    of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock.
     You shall eat it before Yahweh your God year by
    year in the place which Yahweh shall choose, you
    and your household.  If it has any defect-is lame
    or blind, or has any defect whatever, you shall not
    sacrifice it to Yahweh your God.  You shall eat it
    within your gates. The unclean and the clean shall
    eat it alike, as the gazelle and as the deer.  Only
    you shall not eat its blood. You shall pour it out on
    the ground like water.
    
     Observe the month of Abib, and keep the
    Passover to Yahweh your God; for in the month of
    Abib Yahweh your God brought you out of Egypt by
    night.  You shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh
    your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place
    which Yahweh shall choose to cause his name to
    dwell there.  You shall eat no leavened bread with
    it. You shall eat unleavened bread with it seven
    days, even the bread of affliction (for you came
    out of the land of Egypt in haste) that you may
      
    remember the day when you came out of the land
    of Egypt all the days of your life.  No yeast shall
    be seen with you in all your borders seven days;
    neither shall any of the meat, which you sacrifice
    the first day at evening, remain all night until the
    morning.  You may not sacrifice the Passover
    within any of your gates which Yahweh your God
    gives you;  but at the place which Yahweh your God
    shall choose to cause his name to dwell in, there you
    shall sacrifice the Passover at evening, at the going
    down of the sun, at the season that you came out
    of Egypt.  You shall roast and eat it in the place
    which Yahweh your God chooses. In the morning
    you shall return to your tents.  Six days you shall
    eat unleavened bread. On the seventh day shall be
    a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God. You shall
    do no work.
     You shall count for yourselves seven weeks.
    From the time you begin to put the sickle to the
    standing grain you shall begin to count seven weeks.
     You shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh
    your God with a tribute of a free will offering of
    your hand, which you shall give according to how
    Yahweh your God blesses you.  You shall rejoice
    before Yahweh your God: you, your son, your
    daughter, your male servant, your female servant,
    the Levite who is within your gates, the foreigner,
    the fatherless, and the widow who are among you,
    in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose
    to cause his name to dwell there.  You shall
    remember that you were a slave in Egypt. You shall
    observe and do these statutes.
     You shall keep the feast of booths seven days,
    after you have gathered in from your threshing
    floor and from your wine press.  You shall rejoice
    in your feast, you, your son, your daughter, your
    male servant, your female servant, the Levite, the
    foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow who are
    within your gates.  You shall keep a feast to
    Yahweh your God seven days in the place which
    Yahweh chooses, because Yahweh your God will
    bless you in all your increase and in all the work
    of your hands, and you shall be altogether joyful.
     Three times in a year all of your males shall
    appear before Yahweh your God in the place which
    he chooses: in the feast of unleavened bread, in the
    feast of weeks, and in the feast of booths. They
    shall not appear before Yahweh empty.  Every
    man shall give as he is able, according to Yahweh
    your God's blessing which he has given you.  You
    shall make judges and officers in all your gates,
    which Yahweh your God gives you, according to
    your tribes; and they shall judge the people with
    righteous judgment. You shall not pervert justice.
    You shall not show partiality. You shall not take a
    bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and
    perverts the words of the righteous.  You shall
    follow that which is altogether just, that you may
    live and inherit the land which Yahweh your God
    gives you.  You shall not plant for yourselves an
    Asherah of any kind of tree beside Yahweh your
    God's altar, which you shall make for yourselves.
     Neither shall you set yourself up a sacred stone
    which Yahweh your God hates.
    
     You shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an
    ox or a sheep in which is a defect or anything evil;
    for that is an abomination to Yahweh your God.
     If there is found among you, within any of your
    gates which Yahweh your God gives you, a man or
    woman who does that which is evil in Yahweh your
    God's sight in transgressing his covenant,  and has
    gone and served other gods and worshiped them,
    or the sun, or the moon, or any of the stars of the
    sky, which I have not commanded,  and you are
    told, and you have heard of it, then you shall inquire
    diligently. Behold, if it is true, and the thing certain,
    that such abomination is done in Israel,  then you
    shall bring out that man or that woman who has
    done this evil thing to your gates, even that same
    man or woman; and you shall stone them to death
    with stones.  At the mouth of two witnesses, or
    three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to
    death. At the mouth of one witness he shall not be
    put to death.  The hands of the witnesses shall be
    first on him to put him to death, and afterward the
    hands of all the people. So you shall remove the evil
    from among you.
     If there arises a matter too hard for you in
    judgment, between blood and blood, between plea
    and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being
    matters of controversy within your gates, then you
    shall arise, and go up to the place which Yahweh
    your God chooses.  You shall come to the priests
    who are Levites and to the judge who shall be in
    those days. You shall inquire, and they shall give
    you the verdict.  You shall do according to the
    decisions of the verdict which they shall give you
    from that place which Yahweh chooses. You shall
    observe to do according to all that they shall teach
    you.  According to the decisions of the law which
    they shall teach you, and according to the judgment
    which they shall tell you, you shall do. You shall not
    turn away from the sentence which they announce
    to you, to the right hand, nor to the left.  The man
    who does presumptuously in not listening to the
    priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh
    your God, or to the judge, even that man shall
    die. You shall put away the evil from Israel.  All
    the people shall hear and fear, and do no more
    presumptuously.
    When you have come to the land which Yahweh
    your God gives you, and possess it and dwell in
    it, and say, 'I will set a king over me, like all the
    nations that are around me,'  you shall surely set
    him whom Yahweh your God chooses as king over
    yourselves. You shall set as king over you one from
    among your brothers. You may not put a foreigner
    over you, who is not your brother.  Only he shall
    not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people
    to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply
    horses; because Yahweh has said to you, 'You shall
    not go back that way again.' He shall not multiply
    wives to himself, that his heart not turn away. He
    shall not greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
     It shall be, when he sits on the throne of
    his kingdom, that he shall write himself a copy of
    this law in a book, out of that which is before the
      
    Levitical priests.  It shall be with him, and he shall
    read from it all the days of his life, that he may learn
    to fear Yahweh his God, to keep all the words of
    this law and these statutes, to do them;  that his
    heart not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he
    not turn away from the commandment to the right
    hand, or to the left, to the end that he may prolong
    his days in his kingdom, he and his children, in the
    middle of Israel.
    
     The priests and the Levites-all the tribe of Levi
    -shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel.
    They shall eat the offerings of Yahweh made by fire
    and his portion.  They shall have no inheritance
    among their brothers. Yahweh is their inheritance,
    as he has spoken to them.  This shall be the
    priests' due from the people, from those who offer a
    sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall
    give to the priest: the shoulder, the two cheeks, and
    the inner parts.  You shall give him the first fruits
    of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil, and
    the first of the fleece of your sheep.  For Yahweh
    your God has chosen him out of all your tribes to
    stand to minister in Yahweh's name, him and his
    sons forever.
     If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all
    Israel where he lives, and comes with all the desire
    of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose,
     then he shall minister in the name of Yahweh his
    God, as all his brothers the Levites do, who stand
    there before Yahweh. They shall have like portions
    to eat, in addition to that which comes from the sale
    of his family possessions.
     When you have come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you, you shall not learn to
    imitate the abominations of those nations.  There
    shall not be found with you anyone who makes
    his son or his daughter to pass through the fire,
    one who uses divination, one who tells fortunes,
    or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,  or a charmer,
    or someone who consults with a familiar spirit, or
    a wizard, or a necromancer.  For whoever does
    these things is an abomination to Yahweh. Because
    of these abominations, Yahweh your God drives
    them out from before you. You shall be blameless
    with Yahweh your God.  For these nations that you
    shall dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery
    and to diviners; but as for you, Yahweh your God has
    not allowed you so to do.  Yahweh your God will
    raise up to you a prophet from among you, of your
    brothers, like me. You shall listen to him.  This
    is according to all that you desired of Yahweh your
    God in Horeb in the day of the assembly,saying, 'Let
    me not hear again Yahweh my God's voice, neither
    let me see this great fire any more, that I not die.'
     Yahweh said to me, 'They have well said that
    which they have spoken.  I will raise them up
    a prophet from among their brothers, like you. I
    will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak
    to them all that I shall command him.  It shall
    happen, that whoever will not listen to my words
    which he shall speak in my name, I will require
    it of him.  But the prophet who speaks a word
    presumptuously in my name, which I have not
    commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the
    name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.'
    You may say in your heart, 'How shall we know
    the word which Yahweh has not spoken?'  When
    a prophet speaks in Yahweh's name, if the thing
    doesn't follow, nor happen, that is the thing which
    Yahweh has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it
    presumptuously. You shall not be afraid of him.
    
     When Yahweh your God cuts off the nations
    whose land Yahweh your God gives you, and you
    succeed them and dwell in their cities and in their
    houses,  you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the middle of your land, which Yahweh
    your God gives you to possess.  You shall prepare
    the way, and divide the borders of your land which
    Yahweh your God causes you to inherit into three
    parts, that every man slayer may flee there.  This
    is the case of the man slayer who shall flee there and
    live: Whoever kills his neighbor unintentionally,
    and didn't hate him in time past-  as when a man
    goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood
    and his hand swings the ax to cut down the tree,
    and the head slips from the handle and hits his
    neighbor so that he dies -he shall flee to one of
    these cities and live.  Otherwise, the avenger of
    blood might pursue the man slayer while hot anger
    is in his heart and overtake him, because the way
    is long, and strike him mortally, even though he
    was not worthy of death, because he didn't hate
    him in time past.  Therefore I command you to
    set apart three cities for yourselves.  If Yahweh
    your God enlarges your border, as he has sworn to
    your fathers, and gives you all the land which he
    promised to give to your fathers;  and if you keep all
    this commandment to do it, which I command you
    today, to love Yahweh your God, and to walk ever
    in his ways, then you shall add three cities more for
    yourselves, in addition to these three.  This is so
    that innocent blood will not be shed in the middle
    of your land which Yahweh your God gives you for
    an inheritance, leaving blood guilt on you.  But
    if any man hates his neighbor, lies in wait for him,
    rises up against him,strikes him mortally so that he
    dies, and he flees into one of these cities;  then the
    elders of his city shall send and bring him there, and
    deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood,
    that he may die.  Your eye shall not pity him, but
    you shall purge the innocent blood from Israel that
    it may go well with you.
     You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark, which they of old time have set, in your
    inheritance which you shall inherit, in the land that
    Yahweh your God gives you to possess.
     One witness shall not rise up against a man for
    any iniquity, or for any sin that he sins. At the
    mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three
    witnesses, shall a matter be established.  If an
    unrighteous witness rises up against any man to
    testify against him of wrongdoing,  then both the
    men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand
    before Yahweh, before the priests and the judges
      
    who shall be in those days;  and the judges shall
    make diligent inquisition; and behold, if the witness
    is a false witness, and has testified falsely against
    his brother,  then you shall do to him as he had
    thought to do to his brother. So you shall remove
    the evil from among you.  Those who remain shall
    hear, and fear, and will never again commit any
    such evil among you. Your eyes shall not pity: life
    for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand,
    foot for foot.
    
     When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses, chariots, and a people more
    numerous than you, you shall not be afraid of them;
    for Yahweh your God, who brought you up out of
    the land of Egypt, is with you.  It shall be, when
    you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall
    approach and speak to the people,  and shall tell
    them, 'Hear, Israel, you draw near today to battle
    against your enemies. Don't let your heart faint!
    Don't be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of
    them;  for Yahweh your God is he who goes with
    you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save
    you.'
     The officers shall speak to the people, saying,
    'What man is there who has built a new house, and
    has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his
    house, lest he die in the battle, and another man
    dedicate it.  What man is there who has planted
    a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go
    and return to his house, lest he die in the battle,
    and another man use its fruit.  What man is there
    who has pledged to be married to a wife, and has
    not taken her? Let him go and return to his house,
    lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.'
     The officers shall speak further to the people, and
    they shall say, 'What man is there who is fearful and
    faint-hearted? Let him go and return to his house,
    lest his brother's heart melt as his heart.'  It shall
    be, when the officers have finished speaking to the
    people, that they shall appoint captains of armies at
    the head of the people.
     When you draw near to a city to fight against
    it, then proclaim peace to it.  It shall be, if it gives
    you answer of peace and opens to you, then it shall
    be that all the people who are found therein shall
    become forced laborers to you, and shall serve you.
     If it will make no peace with you, but will make
    war against you, then you shall besiege it.  When
    Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand, you
    shall strike every male of it with the edge of the
    sword;  but the women, the little ones, the livestock, and all that is in the city, even all its plunder,
    you shall take for plunder for yourself. You may use
    the plunder of your enemies, which Yahweh your
    God has given you.  Thus you shall do to all the
    cities which are very far off from you, which are not
    of the cities of these nations.  But of the cities
    of these peoples that Yahweh your God gives you
    for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that
    breathes;  but you shall utterly destroy them: the
    Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite,
    theHivite, and the Jebusite, as Yahweh your God has
    commanded you;  that they notteach you to follow
    all their abominations, which they have done for
    their gods; so would you sin against Yahweh your
    God.  When you shall besiege a city a long time,
    in making war against it to take it, you shall not
    destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them; for
    you may eat of them. You shall not cut them down,
    for is the tree of the field man, that it should be
    besieged by you? Only the trees that you know are
    not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them
    down. You shall build bulwarks against the city that
    makes war with you, until it falls.
    
     If someone is found slain in the land which
    Yahweh your God gives you to possess, lying in the
    field, and it isn't known who has struck him,  then
    your elders and your judges shall come out, and
    they shall measure to the cities which are around
    him who is slain.  It shall be that the elders of
    the city which is nearest to the slain man shall
    take a heifer of the herd, which hasn't been worked
    with and which has not drawn in the yoke.  The
    elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a
    valley with running water, which is neither plowed
    nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there
    in the valley.  The priests the sons of Levi shall
    come near, for them Yahweh your God has chosen
    to minister to him, and to bless in Yahweh's name;
    and according to their word shall every controversy
    and every assault be decided.  All the elders of
    that city which is nearest to the slain man shall
    wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was
    broken in the valley.  They shall answer and say,
    'Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have
    our eyes seen it.  Forgive, Yahweh, your people
    Israel, whom you have redeemed, and don't allow
    innocent blood among your people Israel.' The
    blood shall be forgiven them. So you shall put away
    the innocent blood from among you, when you shall
    do that which is right in Yahweh's eyes.
     When you go out to battle against your enemies, and Yahweh your God delivers them into your
    hands and you carry them away captive,  and see
    among the captives a beautiful woman, and you are
    attracted to her, and desire to take her as your wife,
     then you shall bring her home to your house.
    She shall shave her head and trim her nails.  She
    shall take off the clothing of her captivity, and shall
    remain in your house, and bewail her father and her
    mother a full month. After that you shall go in to
    her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
     It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you
    shall let her go where she desires; but you shall not
    sell her at all for money. You shall not deal with her
    as a slave, because you have humbled her.
     If a man has two wives, the one beloved and
    the other hated, and they have borne him children,
    both the beloved and the hated, and if the firstborn
    son is hers who was hated,  then it shall be, in the
    day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he
    has, that he may not give the son of the beloved the
    rights of the firstborn before the son of the hated,
    who is the firstborn;  but he shall acknowledge
      
    the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him
    a double portion of all that he has; for he is the
    beginning of his strength. The right of the firstborn
    is his.
     If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who
    will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of
    his mother, and though they chasten him, will not
    listen to them,  then his father and his mother
    shall take hold of him and bring him out to the
    elders of his city and to the gate of his place. They
    shall tell the elders of his city, 'This our son is
    stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey our voice.
    He is a glutton and a drunkard.'  All the men of
    his city shall stone him to death with stones. So
    you shall remove the evil from among you. All Israel
    shall hear, and fear.
     If a man has committed a sin worthy of death,
    and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree,
     his body shall not remain all night on the tree,
    but you shall surely bury him the same day; for
    he who is hanged is accursed of God. Don't defile
    your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an
    inheritance.
    
     You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep
    go astray and hide yourself from them. You shall
    surely bring them again to your brother.  If your
    brother isn't near to you, or if you don't know him,
    then you shall bring it home to your house, and it
    shall be with you until your brother comes looking
    for it, and you shall restore it to him.  So you
    shall do with his donkey. So you shall do with his
    garment. So you shall do with every lost thing
    of your brother's, which he has lost and you have
    found. You may not hide yourself.  You shall not
    see your brother's donkey or his ox fallen down by
    the way, and hide yourself from them. You shall
    surely help him to lift them up again.
    A woman shall not wear men's clothing, neither
    shall a man put on women's clothing; for whoever
    does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your
    God.
     If you come across a bird's nest on the way, in
    any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs,
    and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs,
    you shall not take the hen with the young.  You
    shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may
    take for yourself, that it may be well with you, and
    that you may prolong your days.
     When you build a new house, then you shall
    make a railing around your roof, so that you don't
    bring blood on your house if anyone falls from
    there.
     You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds
    of seed, lest all the fruit be defiled, the seed which
    you have sown, and the increase of the vineyard.
     You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey
    together.  You shall not wear clothes of wool and
    linen woven together.
     You shall make yourselves fringes* on the four
    corners of your cloak with which you cover yourself.
     If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her,
    hates her,  accuses her of shameful things, gives
    her a bad name, and says, 'I took this woman, and
    when I came near to her, I didn't find in her the
    tokens of virginity;'  then the young lady's father
    and mother shall take and bring the tokens of the
    young lady's virginity to the elders of the city in
    the gate.  The young lady's father shall tell the
    elders, 'I gave my daughter to this man as his wife,
    and he hates her.  Behold, he has accused her
    of shameful things, saying, 'I didn't find in your
    daughter the tokens of virginity;' and yet these are
    the tokens of my daughter's virginity.' They shall
    spread the cloth before the elders of the city.  The
    elders of that city shall take the man and chastise
    him.  They shall fine him one hundred shekels of
    silver, and give them to the father of the young
    lady, because he has given a bad name to a virgin
    of Israel. She shall be his wife. He may not put her
    away all his days.
     But if this thing is true, that the tokens of
    virginity were not found in the young lady,  then
    they shall bring out the young lady to the door of
    her father's house, and the men of her city shall
    stone her to death with stones, because she has
    done folly in Israel, to play the prostitute in her
    father's house. So you shall remove the evil from
    among you.
     If a man is found lying with a woman married
    to a husband, then they shall both die, the man
    who lay with the woman and the woman. So you
    shall remove the evil from Israel.  If there is a
    young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married
    to a husband, and a man finds her in the city, and
    lies with her,  then you shall bring them both out
    to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them
    to death with stones; the lady, because she didn't
    cry, being in the city; and the man, because he has
    humbled his neighbor's wife. So you shall remove
    the evil from among you.  But if the man finds the
    lady who is pledged to be married in the field, and
    the man forces her and lies with her, then only the
    man who lay with her shall die;  but to the lady
    you shall do nothing. There is in the lady no sin
    worthy of death; for as when a man rises against his
    neighbor and kills him, even so is this matter;  for
    he found her in the field, the pledged to be married
    lady cried, and there was no one to save her.  If a
    man finds a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged
    to be married, grabs her and lies with her, and they
    are found,  then the man who lay with her shall
    give to the lady's father fifty shekels of silver. She
    shall be his wife, because he has humbled her. He
    may not put her away all his days.  A man shall
    not take his father's wife, and shall not uncover his
    father's skirt.
    
     He who is emasculated by crushing or cutting
    shall not enter into Yahweh's assembly.  A person
    born of a forbidden union shall not enter into
    Yahweh's assembly; even to the tenth generation

      
    shall no one of his enter into Yahweh's assembly.
     An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into
    Yahweh's assembly; even to the tenth generation
    shall no one belonging to them enter into Yahweh's assembly forever,  because they didn't meet
    you with bread and with water on the way when
    you came out of Egypt, and because they hired
    against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of
    Mesopotamia, to curse you.  Nevertheless Yahweh
    your God wouldn't listen to Balaam, but Yahweh
    your God turned the curse into a blessing to you,
    because Yahweh your God loved you. You shall not
    seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days
    forever.  You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he
    is your brother. You shall not abhor an Egyptian,
    because you lived as a foreigner in his land.  The
    children of the third generation who are born to
    them may enter into Yahweh's assembly.
     When you go out and camp against your enemies, then you shall keep yourselves from every
    evil thing.  If there is among you any man who
    is not clean by reason of that which happens to
    him by night, then shall he go outside of the camp.
    He shall not come within the camp;  but it shall
    be, when evening comes, he shall bathe himself in
    water. When the sun is down, he shall come within
    the camp.  You shall have a place also outside
    of the camp where you go relieve yourself.  You
    shall have a trowel among your weapons. It shall
    be, when you relieve yourself, you shall dig with it,
    and shall turn back and cover your excrement;  for
    Yahweh your God walks in the middle of your camp,
    to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before
    you. Therefore your camp shall be holy, that he may
    not see an unclean thing in you, and turn away from
    you.
     You shall not deliver to his master a servant
    who has escaped from his master to you.  He
    shall dwell with you, among you, in the place which
    he shall choose within one of your gates, where it
    pleases him best. You shall not oppress him.
     There shall be no prostitute of the daughters
    of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the
    sons of Israel.  You shall not bring the hire of a
    prostitute, or the wages of a male prostitute,* into
    the house of Yahweh your God for any vow; for both
    of these are an abomination to Yahweh your God.
     You shall not lend on interest to your brother:
    interest of money, interest of food, interest of
    anything that is lent on interest.  You may charge
    a foreigner interest; but you shall not charge your
    brother interest, that Yahweh your God may bless
    you in all that you put your hand to, in the land
    where you go in to possess it.
     When you vow a vow to Yahweh your God, you
    shall not be slack to pay it, for Yahweh your God
    will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in
    you.  But if you refrain from making a vow, it shall
    be no sin in you.  You shall observe and do that
    which has gone out of your lips. Whatever you have
    vowed to Yahweh your God as a free will offering,
    which you have promised with your mouth, you
    must do.  When you come into your neighbor's
    vineyard, then you may eat your fill of grapes at
    your own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your
    container.  When you come into your neighbor's
    standing grain, then you may pluck the ears with
    your hand; but you shall not use a sickle on your
    neighbor's standing grain.
    
     When a man takes a wife and marries her, then
    it shall be, if she finds no favor in his eyes because
    he has found some unseemly thing in her, that he
    shall write her a certificate of divorce, put it in her
    hand, and send her out of his house.  When she
    has departed out of his house, she may go and be
    another man's wife.  If the latter husband hates
    her, and writes her a certificate of divorce, puts it
    in her hand, and sends her out of his house; or if
    the latter husband dies, who took her to be his wife;
     her former husband, who sent her away, may not
    take her again to be his wife after she is defiled; for
    that would be an abomination to Yahweh. You shall
    not cause the land to sin, which Yahweh your God
    gives you for an inheritance.  When a man takes a
    new wife, he shall not go out in the army, neither
    shall he be assigned any business. He shall be free
    at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he
    has taken.
     No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone as a pledge, for he takes a life in pledge.
     If a man is found stealing any of his brothers
    of the children of Israel, and he deals with him as
    a slave, or sells him, then that thief shall die. So you
    shall remove the evil from among you.
     Be careful in the plague of leprosy, that you
    observe diligently and do according to all that the
    Levitical priests teach you. As I commanded them,
    so you shall observe to do.  Remember what
    Yahweh your God did to Miriam, by the way as you
    came out of Egypt.
     When you lend your neighbor any kind of loan,
    you shall not go into his house to get his pledge.
    You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you
    lend shall bring the pledge outside to you.  If he
    is a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge.
     You shall surely restore to him the pledge when
    the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment
    and bless you. It shall be righteousness to you
    before Yahweh your God.
     You shall not oppress a hired servant who is
    poor and needy, whether he is one of your brothers
    or one of the foreigners who are in your land within
    your gates.  In his day you shall give him his wages,
    neither shall the sun go down on it, for he is poor
    and sets his heart on it, lest he cry against you to
    Yahweh, and it be sin to you.
     The fathers shall not be put to death for the
    children, neither shall the children be put to death
    for the fathers. Every man shall be put to death for
    his own sin.
     You shall not deprive the foreigner or the
    fatherless of justice, nor take a widow's clothing in
    pledge;  but you shall remember that you were a

      
    slave in Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you
    there. Therefore I command you to do this thing.
     When you reap your harvest in your field, and
    have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not
    go again to get it. It shall be for the foreigner, for
    the fatherless, and for the widow, that Yahweh your
    God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
     When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go
    over the boughs again. It shall be for the foreigner,
    for the fatherless, and for the widow.
     When you harvest your vineyard, you shall
    not glean it after yourselves. It shall be for the
    foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
     You shall remember that you were a slave in the
    land of Egypt. Therefore I command you to do this
    thing.
    
     If there is a controversy between men, and they
    come to judgment and the judges judge them, then
    they shall justify the righteous and condemn the
    wicked.  It shall be, if the wicked man is worthy
    to be beaten, that the judge shall cause him to lie
    down and to be beaten before his face, according
    to his wickedness, by number.  He may sentence
    him to no more than forty stripes. He shall not give
    more, lest if he should give more and beat him more
    than that many stripes, then your brother will be
    degraded in your sight.
     You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out
    the grain.
     If brothers dwell together, and one of them
    dies and has no son, the wife of the dead shall not
    be married outside to a stranger. Her husband's
    brother shall go in to her, and take her as his wife,
    and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her.
     It shall be that the firstborn whom she bears shall
    succeed in the name of his brother who is dead, that
    his name not be blotted out of Israel.
     If the man doesn't want to take his brother's
    wife, then his brother's wife shall go up to the
    gate to the elders, and say, 'My husband's brother
    refuses to raise up to his brother a name in Israel. He
    will not perform the duty of a husband's brother to
    me.'  Then the elders of his city shall call him, and
    speak to him. If he stands and says, 'I don't want
    to take her,'  then his brother's wife shall come
    to him in the presence of the elders, and loose his
    sandal from off his foot, and spit in his face. She
    shall answer and say, 'So shall it be done to the man
    who does not build up his brother's house.'  His
    name shall be called in Israel, 'The house of him
    who had his sandal removed.'
     When men strive against each other, and the
    wife of one draws near to deliver her husband out of
    the hand of him who strikes him, and puts out her
    hand, and grabs him by his private parts,  then you
    shall cut off her hand. Your eye shall have no pity.
     You shall not have in your bag diverse weights,
    one heavy and one light.  You shall not have in
    your house diverse measures, one large and one
    small.  You shall have a perfect and just weight.
    You shall have a perfect and just measure, that your
    days may be long in the land which Yahweh your
    God gives you.  For all who do such things, all who
    do unrighteously, are an abomination to Yahweh
    your God.
     Remember what Amalek did to you by the way
    as you came out of Egypt,  how he met you by the
    way, and struck the rearmost of you, all who were
    feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary;
    and he didn't fear God.  Therefore it shall be,
    when Yahweh your God has given you rest from all
    your enemies all around, in the land which Yahweh
    your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it,
    that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from
    under the sky. You shall not forget.
    
     It shall be, when you have come in to the land
    which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance, possess it, and dwell in it,  that you shall take
    some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which
    you shall bring in from your land that Yahweh your
    God gives you. You shall put it in a basket, and shall
    go to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose
    to cause his name to dwell there.  You shall come
    to the priest who shall be in those days, and tell
    him, 'I profess today to Yahweh your God, that I
    have come to the land which Yahweh swore to our
    fathers to give us.'  The priest shall take the basket
    out of your hand, and set it down before Yahweh
    your God's altar.  You shall answer and say before
    Yahweh your God, 'My father* was a Syrian ready to
    perish. He went down into Egypt, and lived there,
    few in number. There he became a great, mighty,
    and populous nation. The Egyptians mistreated us,
    afflicted us, and imposed hard labor on us.  Then
    we cried to Yahweh, the God of our fathers. Yahweh
    heard our voice, and saw our affliction, our toil, and
    our oppression.  Yahweh brought us out of Egypt
    with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, with
    great terror, with signs, and with wonders;  and
    he has brought us into this place, and has given
    us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
     Now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit
    of the ground, which you, Yahweh, have given me.'
    You shall set it down before Yahweh your God,
    and worship before Yahweh your God.  You shall
    rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God has
    given to you, and to your house, you, and the Levite,
    and the foreigner who is among you.
     When you have finished tithing all the tithe of
    your increase in the third year, which is the year
    of tithing, then you shall give it to the Levite, to
    the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow,
    that they may eat within your gates and be filled.
    You shall say before Yahweh your God, 'I have put
    away the holy things out of my house, and also have
    given them to the Levite, to the foreigner, to the
    fatherless, and to the widow, according to all your
    commandment which you have commanded me. I
    have not transgressed any of your commandments,
    neither have I forgotten them.  I have not eaten
    of it in my mourning, neither have I removed any of
    it while I was unclean, nor given of it for the dead.
    * : or, forefather
      
    I have listened to Yahweh my God's voice. I have
    done according to all that you have commanded
    me.  Look down from your holy habitation,
    from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the
    ground which you have given us, as you swore to our
    fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.'
     Today Yahweh your God commands you to do
    these statutes and ordinances. You shall therefore
    keep and do them with all your heart and with
    all your soul.  You have declared today that
    Yahweh is your God, and that you would walk in
    his ways, keep his statutes, his commandments, and
    his ordinances, and listen to his voice.  Yahweh
    has declared today that you are a people for his
    own possession, as he has promised you, and that
    you should keep all his commandments.  He will
    make you high above all nations that he has made, in
    praise, in name, and in honor, and that you may be a
    holy people to Yahweh your God, as he has spoken.
    
     Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the
    people, saying, 'Keep all the commandment which
    I command you today.  It shall be on the day
    when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land
    which Yahweh your God gives you, that you shall
    set yourself up great stones, and coat them with
    plaster.  You shall write on them all the words of
    this law, when you have passed over, that you may
    go in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you,
    a land flowing with milk and honey, as Yahweh, the
    God of your fathers, has promised you.  It shall
    be, when you have crossed over the Jordan, that
    you shall set up these stones, which I command you
    today, on Mount Ebal, and you shall coat them with
    plaster.  There you shall build an altar to Yahweh
    your God, an altar of stones. You shall not use any
    iron tool on them.  You shall build Yahweh your
    God's altar of uncut stones. You shall offer burnt
    offerings on it to Yahweh your God.  You shall
    sacrifice peace offerings, and shall eat there. You
    shall rejoice before Yahweh your God.  You shall
    write on the stones all the words of this law very
    plainly.'
     Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel, saying, 'Be silent and listen, Israel! Today you
    have become the people of Yahweh your God. You
    shall therefore obey Yahweh your God's voice, and
    do his commandments and his statutes, which I
    command you today.'
     Moses commanded the people the same day,
    saying,  'These shall stand on Mount Gerizim
    to bless the people, when you have crossed over
    the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph,
    and Benjamin.  These shall stand on Mount Ebal
    for the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan,
    and Naphtali.  With a loud voice, the Levites
    shall say to all the men of Israel,  'Cursed is the
    man who makes an engraved or molten image, an
    abomination to Yahweh, the work of the hands of
    the craftsman, and sets it up in secret.'
    All the people shall answer and say, 'Amen.'
     'Cursed is he who dishonors his father or his
    mother.'
    All the people shall say, 'Amen.'
     'Cursed is he who removes his neighbor's landmark.'
    All the people shall say, 'Amen.'
     'Cursed is he who leads the blind astray on the
    road.'
    All the people shall say, 'Amen.'
     'Cursed is he who withholds justice from the
    foreigner, fatherless, and widow.'
    All the people shall say, 'Amen.'
     'Cursed is he who lies with* his father's wife,
    because he dishonors his father's bed.'
    All the people shall say, 'Amen.'
     'Cursed is he who lies with any kind of animal.'
    All the people shall say, 'Amen.'
     'Cursed is he who lies with his sister, his
    father's daughter or his mother's daughter.'
    All the people shall say, 'Amen.'
     'Cursed is he who lies with his mother-in-law.'
    All the people shall say, 'Amen.'
     'Cursed is he who secretly kills his neighbor.'
    All the people shall say, 'Amen.'
     'Cursed is he who takes a bribe to kill an
    innocent person.'
    All the people shall say, 'Amen.'
     'Cursed is he who doesn't uphold the words of
    this law by doing them.'
    All the people shall say, 'Amen.' '
    
     It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently
    to Yahweh your God's voice, to observe to do all
    his commandments which I command you today,
    that Yahweh your God will set you high above all
    the nations of the earth.  All these blessings will
    come upon you, and overtake you, if you listen to
    Yahweh your God's voice.  You shall be blessed
    in the city, and you shall be blessed in the field.
     You shall be blessed in the fruit of your body, the
    fruit of your ground, the fruit of your animals, the
    increase of your livestock, and the young of your
    flock.  Your basket and your kneading trough shall
    be blessed. You shall be blessed when you come in,
    and you shall be blessed when you go out. Yahweh
    will cause your enemies who rise up against you to
    be struck before you. They will come out against
    you one way, and will flee before you seven ways.
     Yahweh will command the blessing on you in your
    barns, and in all that you put your hand to. He
    will bless you in the land which Yahweh your God
    gives you.  Yahweh will establish you for a holy
    people to himself, as he has sworn to you, if you
    shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God,
    and walk in his ways.  All the peoples of the earth
    shall see that you are called by Yahweh's name, and
    they will be afraid of you.  Yahweh will grant you
    abundant prosperity in the fruit of your body, in
    the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your
    ground, in the land which Yahweh swore to your
    fathers to give you.  Yahweh will open to you his
    good treasure in the sky, to give the rain of your

      
    land in its season, and to bless all the work of your
    hand. You will lend to many nations, and you will
    not borrow.  Yahweh will make you the head, and
    not the tail. You will be above only, and you will not
    be beneath, if you listen to the commandments of
    Yahweh your God which I command you today, to
    observe and to do,  and shall not turn away from
    any of the words which I command you today, to
    the right hand or to the left, to go after other gods
    to serve them.
     But it shall come to pass, if you will not listen
    to Yahweh your God's voice, to observe to do all his
    commandments and his statutes which I command
    you today, that all these curses will come on you and
    overtake you.  You will be cursed in the city, and
    you will be cursed in the field.  Your basket and
    your kneading trough will be cursed.  The fruit
    of your body, the fruit of your ground, the increase
    of your livestock, and the young of your flock will
    be cursed.  You will be cursed when you come in,
    and you will be cursed when you go out.  Yahweh
    will send on you cursing, confusion, and rebuke
    in all that you put your hand to do, until you are
    destroyed and until you perish quickly, because of
    the evil of your doings, by which you have forsaken
    me. Yahweh will make the pestilence cling to you,
    until he has consumed you from off the land where
    you go in to possess it.  Yahweh will strike you
    with consumption, with fever, with inflammation,
    with fiery heat, with the sword, with blight, and
    with mildew. They will pursue you until you perish.
    Your sky that is over your head will be bronze, and
    the earth that is under you will be iron.  Yahweh
    will make the rain of your land powder and dust. It
    will come down on you from the sky, until you are
    destroyed.  Yahweh will cause you to be struck
    before your enemies. You will go out one way
    against them, and will flee seven ways before them.
    You will be tossed back and forth among all the
    kingdoms of the earth.  Your dead bodies will be
    food to all birds of the sky, and to the animals of
    the earth; and there will be no one to frighten them
    away.  Yahweh will strike you with the boils of
    Egypt, with the tumors, with the scurvy, and with
    the itch, of which you can not be healed.  Yahweh
    will strike you with madness, with blindness, and
    with astonishment of heart.  You will grope at
    noonday, as the blind gropes in darkness, and you
    shall not prosper in your ways. You will only be
    oppressed and robbed always, and there will be no
    one to save you.  You will betroth a wife, and
    another man shall lie with her. You will build a
    house, and you won't dwell in it. You will plant a
    vineyard, and not use its fruit.  Your ox will be
    slain before your eyes, and you will not eat any of
    it. Your donkey will be violently taken away from
    before your face, and will not be restored to you.
    Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and you
    will have no one to save you.  Your sons and your
    daughters will be given to another people. Your
    eyes will look and fail with longing for them all day
    long. There will be no power in your hand.  A
    nation which you don't know will eat the fruit of
    your ground and all of your work. You will only be
    oppressed and crushed always,  so that the sights
    that you see with your eyes will drive you mad.
     Yahweh will strike you in the knees and in the
    legs with a sore boil, of which you cannot be healed,
    from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.
     Yahweh will bring you, and your king whom you
    will set over yourselves, to a nation that you have
    not known, you nor your fathers. There you will
    serve other gods of wood and stone.  You will
    become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword
    among all the peoples where Yahweh will lead you
    away.  You will carry much seed out into the field,
    and will gather little in, for the locust will consume
    it.  You will plant vineyards and dress them, but
    you will neither drink of the wine, nor harvest,
    because worms will eat them.  You will have olive
    trees throughout all your borders, but you won't
    anoint yourself with the oil, for your olives will drop
    off.  You will father sons and daughters, but they
    will not be yours, for they will go into captivity.
    Locusts will consume all of your trees and the fruit
    of your ground.  The foreigner who is among you
    will mount up above you higher and higher, and you
    will come down lower and lower.  He will lend to
    you, and you won't lend to him. He will be the head,
    and you will be the tail.
    All these curses will come on you, and will pursue you and overtake you, until you are destroyed,
    because you didn't listen to Yahweh your God's
    voice, to keep his commandments and his statutes
    which he commanded you.  They will be for a
    sign and for a wonder to you and to your offspring
    forever.  Because you didn't serve Yahweh your
    God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart, by
    reason of the abundance of all things;  therefore
    you will serve your enemies whom Yahweh sends
    against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and
    in lack of all things. He will put an iron yoke on
    your neck until he has destroyed you.  Yahweh
    will bring a nation against you from far away, from
    the end of the earth, as the eagle flies: a nation
    whose language you will not understand,  a nation
    of fierce facial expressions, that doesn't respect the
    elderly, nor show favor to the young.  They will
    eat the fruit of your livestock and the fruit of your
    ground, until you are destroyed. They also won't
    leave you grain, new wine, oil, the increase of your
    livestock, or the young of your flock, until they
    have caused you to perish.  They will besiege
    you in all your gates until your high and fortified
    walls in which you trusted come down throughout
    all your land. They will besiege you in all your
    gates throughout all your land which Yahweh your
    God has given you.  You will eat the fruit of
    your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your
    daughters, whom Yahweh your God has given you,
    in the siege and in the distress with which your
    enemies will distress you.  The man who is tender
    among you, and very delicate, his eye will be evil
    toward his brother, toward the wife whom he loves,
    and toward the remnant of his children whom he
    has remaining,  so that he will not give to any
    of them of the flesh of his children whom he will
    eat, because he has nothing left to him, in the
      
    siege and in the distress with which your enemy
    will distress you in all your gates.  The tender
    and delicate woman among you, who would not
    venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground
    for delicateness and tenderness, her eye will be evil
    toward the husband that she loves, toward her son,
    toward her daughter,  toward her young one who
    comes out from between her feet, and toward her
    children whom she bears; for she will eat them
    secretly for lack of all things in the siege and in the
    distress with which your enemy will distress you
    in your gates.  If you will not observe to do all
    the words of this law that are written in this book,
    that you may fear this glorious and fearful name,
    YAHWEH your God,  then Yahweh will make your
    plagues and the plagues of your offspring fearful,
    even great plagues, and of long duration, and severe
    sicknesses, and of long duration. He will bring on
    you again all the diseases of Egypt, which you were
    afraid of; and they will cling to you.  Also every
    sickness and every plague which is not written in
    the book of this law, Yahweh will bring them on
    you until you are destroyed.  You will be left few
    in number, even though you were as the stars of
    the sky for multitude, because you didn't listen to
    Yahweh your God's voice.  It will happen that
    as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good, and
    to multiply you, so Yahweh will rejoice over you
    to cause you to perish and to destroy you. You
    will be plucked from the land that you are going
    in to possess.  Yahweh will scatter you among
    all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other
    end of the earth. There you will serve other gods
    which you have not known, you nor your fathers,
    even wood and stone.  Among these nations you
    will find no ease, and there will be no rest for the
    sole of your foot; but Yahweh will give you there a
    trembling heart, failing of eyes, and pining of soul.
     Your life will hang in doubt before you. You will
    be afraid night and day, and will have no assurance
    of your life.  In the morning you will say, 'I wish it
    were evening!' and at evening you will say, 'I wish
    it were morning!' for the fear of your heart which
    you will fear, and for the sights which your eyes
    will see.  Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again
    with ships, by the way of which I told to you that
    you would never see it again. There you will offer
    yourselves to your enemies for male and female
    slaves, and nobody will buy you.
    
     These are the words of the covenant which
    Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, in addition to
    the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
     Moses called to all Israel, and said to them:
    Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh did in the
    land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,
    and to all his land;  the great trials which your
    eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders.  But
    Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, eyes to
    see, and ears to hear, to this day.  I have led you
    forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have
    not grown old on you, and your sandals have not
    grown old on your feet.  You have not eaten bread,
    neither have you drunk wine or strong drink, that
    you may know that I am Yahweh your God.  When
    you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon
    and Og the king of Bashan came out against us to
    battle, and we struck them. We took their land, and
    gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to
    the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites.
     Therefore keep the words of this covenant and
    do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.
     All of you stand today in the presence of Yahweh
    your God: your heads, your tribes, your elders, and
    your officers, even all the men of Israel,  your little
    ones, your wives, and the foreigners who are in the
    middle of your camps, from the one who cuts your
    wood to the one who draws your water,  that you
    may enter into the covenant of Yahweh your God,
    and into his oath, which Yahweh your God makes
    with you today,  that he may establish you today
    as his people, and that he may be your God, as he
    spoke to you and as he swore to your fathers, to
    Abraham,to Isaac, and to Jacob. Neither do I make
    this covenant and this oath with you only,  but
    with those who stand here with us today before
    Yahweh our God, and also with those who are not
    here with us today  (for you know how we lived
    in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the
    middle of the nations through which you passed;
     and you have seen their abominations and their
    idols of wood, stone, silver, and gold, which were
    among them);  lest there should be among you
    man, woman, family, or tribe whose heart turns
    away today from Yahweh our God, to go to serve the
    gods of those nations; lest there should be among
    you a root that produces bitter poison;  and it
    happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that
    he bless himself in his heart, saying, 'I shall have
    peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my
    heart,' to destroy the moist with the dry. Yahweh
    will not pardon him, but then Yahweh's anger and
    his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the
    curse that is written in this book will fall on him,
    and Yahweh will blot out his name from under the
    sky.  Yahweh will set him apart for evil out of all
    the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the
    covenant written in this book of the law.
     The generation to come -your children who
    will rise up after you, and the foreigner who will
    come from a far land -will say, when they see
    the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with
    which Yahweh has made it sick,  that all of its
    land is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown,
    doesn't produce, nor does any grass grow in it, like
    the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and
    Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and
    in his wrath.  Even all the nations will say, 'Why
    has Yahweh done this to this land? What does the
    heat of this great anger mean?'
     Then men will say, 'Because they abandoned
    the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their fathers,
    which he made with them when he brought them
    out of the land of Egypt,  and went and served
    other gods and worshiped them, gods that they
    didn't know and that he had not given to them.
      
     Therefore Yahweh's anger burned against this
    land, to bring on it all the curses that are written
    in this book.  Yahweh rooted them out of their
    land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation,
    and thrust them into another land, as it is today.'
     The secret things belong to Yahweh our God;
    but the things that are revealed belong to us and to
    our children forever, that we may do all the words
    of this law.
    
     It shall happen, when all these things have come
    on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set
    before you, and you shall call them to mind among
    all the nations where Yahweh your God has driven
    you,  and return to Yahweh your God and obey his
    voice according to all that I command you today,
    you and your children, with all your heart and with
    all your soul,  that then Yahweh your God will
    release you from captivity, have compassion on you,
    and will return and gather you from all the peoples
    where Yahweh your God has scattered you.  If your
    outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens,
    from there Yahweh your God will gather you, and
    from there he will bring you back.  Yahweh your
    God will bring you into the land which your fathers
    possessed, and you will possess it. He will do
    you good, and increase your numbers more than
    your fathers.  Yahweh your God will circumcise
    your heart, and the heart of your offspring, to love
    Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all
    your soul, that you may live.  Yahweh your God
    will put all these curses on your enemies and on
    those who hate you, who persecuted you.  You
    shall return and obey Yahweh's voice, and do all
    his commandments which I command you today.
     Yahweh your God will make you prosperous in all
    the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, in
    the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your
    ground, for good; for Yahweh will again rejoice over
    you for good, as he rejoiced over your fathers,  if
    you will obey Yahweh your God's voice, to keep his
    commandments and his statutes which are written
    in this book of the law, if you turn to Yahweh your
    God with all your heart and with all your soul.
     For this commandment which I command you
    today is not too hard for you or too distant.  It
    is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will go
    up for us to heaven, bring it to us, and proclaim it
    to us, that we may do it?'  Neither is it beyond
    the sea, that you should say, 'Who will go over the
    sea for us, bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that
    we may do it?'  But the word is very near to you,
    in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do
    it.  Behold, I have set before you today life and
    prosperity, and death and evil.  For I command
    you today to love Yahweh your God, to walk in his
    ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes,
    and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply,
    and that Yahweh your God may bless you in the land
    where you go in to possess it.  But if your heart
    turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn
    away and worship other gods, and serve them,  I
    declare to you today that you will surely perish. You
    will not prolong your days in the land where you
    pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it.  I call
    heaven and earth to witness against you today that
    I have set before you life and death, the blessing and
    the curse. Therefore choose life, that you may live,
    you and your descendants,  to love Yahweh your
    God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he
    is your life, and the length of your days, that you
    may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your
    fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give
    them.
    
     Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
     He said to them, 'I am one hundred twenty years
    old today. I can no more go out and come in.
    Yahweh has said to me, 'You shall not go over this
    Jordan.'  Yahweh your God himself will go over
    before you. He will destroy these nations from
    before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua
    will go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken.
     Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and
    to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land,
    when he destroyed them.  Yahweh will deliver
    them up before you, and you shall do to them
    according to all the commandment which I have
    commanded you. Be strong and courageous. Don't
    be afraid or scared of them, for Yahweh your God
    himself is who goes with you. He will not fail you
    nor forsake you.'
     Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the
    sight of all Israel, 'Be strong and courageous, for
    you shall go with this people into the land which
    Yahweh has sworn to their fathers to give them; and
    you shall cause them to inherit it.  Yahweh himself
    is who goes before you. He will be with you. He will
    not fail you nor forsake you. Don't be afraid. Don't
    be discouraged.'
     Moses wrote this law and delivered it to the
    priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of Yahweh's covenant, and to all the elders of Israel.
     Moses commanded them, saying, 'At the end of
    every seven years, in the set time of the year of
    release, in the feast of booths,  when all Israel
    has come to appear before Yahweh your God in the
    place which he will choose, you shall read this law
    before all Israel in their hearing.  Assemble the
    people, the men and the women and the little ones,
    and the foreigners who are within your gates, that
    they may hear, learn, fear Yahweh your God, and
    observe to do all the words of this law,  and that
    their children, who have not known, may hear and
    learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as you live
    in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess
    it.'
     Yahweh said to Moses, 'Behold, your days
    approach that you must die. Call Joshua, and
    present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I
    may commission him.'
    Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.
     Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of
    cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood over the Tent's
    door.  Yahweh said to Moses, 'Behold, you shall
      
    sleep with your fathers. This people will rise up and
    play the prostitute after the strange gods of the land
    where they go to be among them, and will forsake
    me and break my covenant which I have made with
    them.  Then my anger shall be kindled against
    them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will
    hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured,
    and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so
    that they will say in that day, 'Haven't these evils
    come on us because our God is not among us?'  I
    will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil
    which they have done, in that they have turned to
    other gods.
     'Now therefore write this song for yourselves,
    and teach it to the children of Israel. Put it in
    their mouths, that this song may be a witness for
    me against the children of Israel.  For when I
    have brought them into the land which I swore to
    their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and
    they have eaten and filled themselves, and grown
    fat, then they will turn to other gods, and serve
    them, and despise me, and break my covenant.  It
    will happen, when many evils and troubles have
    come on them, that this song will testify before
    them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten out
    of the mouths of their descendants; for I know
    their ways and what they are doing today, before
    I have brought them into the land which I promised
    them.'
     So Moses wrote this song the same day, and
    taught it to the children of Israel.
     He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and
    said, 'Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring
    the children of Israel into the land which I swore to
    them. I will be with you.'
     When Moses had finished writing the words
    of this law in a book, until they were finished,
     Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark
    of Yahweh's covenant, saying,  'Take this book of
    the law, and put it by the side of the ark of Yahweh
    your God's covenant, that it may be there for a
    witness against you. ForI know your rebellion and
    your stiff neck. Behold, while I am yet alive with you
    today, you have been rebellious against Yahweh.
    How much more after my death?  Assemble to
    me all the elders of your tribes and your officers,
    that I may speak these words in their ears, and call
    heaven and earth to witness against them.  For I
    know that after my death you will utterly corrupt
    yourselves, and turn away from the way which I
    have commanded you; and evil will happen to you
    in the latter days, because you will do that which
    is evil in Yahweh's sight, to provoke him to anger
    through the work of your hands.'
     Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly
    of Israel the words of this song, until they were
    finished.
    
     Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak.
    Let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
     My doctrine will drop as the rain.
    My speech will condense as the dew,
    as the misty rain on the tender grass,
    as the showers on the herb.
     For I will proclaim Yahweh's name.
    Ascribe greatness to our God!
     The Rock: his work is perfect,
    for all his ways are just.
    A God of faithfulness who does no wrong,
    just and right is he.
     They have dealt corruptly with him.
    They are not his children, because of their
    defect.
    They are a perverse and crooked generation.
     Is this the way you repay Yahweh,
    foolish and unwise people?
    Isn't he your father who has bought you?
    He has made you and established you.
     Remember the days of old.
    Consider the years of many generations.
    Ask your father, and he will show you;
    your elders, and they will tell you.
     When the Most High gave to the nations their
    inheritance,
    when he separated the children of men,
    he set the bounds of the peoples
    according to the number of the children of
    Israel.
     For Yahweh's portion is his people.
    Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
     He found him in a desert land,
    in the waste howling wilderness.
    He surrounded him.
    He cared for him.
    He kept him as the apple of his eye.
     As an eagle that stirs up her nest,
    that flutters over her young,
    he spread abroad his wings,
    he took them,
    he bore them on his feathers.
     Yahweh alone led him.
    There was no foreign god with him.
    He made him ride on the high places of the earth.
    He ate the increase of the field.
    He caused him to suck honey out of the rock,
    oil out of the flinty rock;
     butter from the herd, and milk from the flock,
    with fat of lambs,
    rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,
    with the finest of the wheat.
    From the blood of the grape, you drank wine.
     But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked.
    You have grown fat.
    You have grown thick.
    You have become sleek.
    Then he abandoned God who made him,
    and rejected the Rock of his salvation.
     They moved him to jealousy with strange gods.
    They provoked him to anger with abominations.
     They sacrificed to demons, not God,
    to gods that they didn't know,
    to new gods that came up recently,
    which your fathers didn't dread.
     Of the Rock who became your father, you are
    unmindful,
    and have forgotten God who gave you birth.
      
     Yahweh saw and abhorred,
    because of the provocation of his sons and his
    daughters.
     He said, 'I will hide my face from them.
    I will see what their end will be;
    for they are a very perverse generation,
    children in whom is no faithfulness.
     They have moved me to jealousy with that which
    is not God.
    They have provoked me to anger with their
    vanities.
    I will move them to jealousy with those who are not
    a people.
    I will provoke them to anger with a foolish
    nation.
     For a fire is kindled in my anger,
    that burns to the lowest Sheol,*
    devours the earth with its increase,
    and sets the foundations of the mountains on
    fire.
     'I will heap evils on them.
    I will spend my arrows on them.
     They shall be wasted with hunger,
    and devoured with burning heat
    and bitter destruction.
    I will send the teeth of animals on them,
    with the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.
     Outside the sword will bereave,
    and in the rooms,
    terror on both young man and virgin,
    the nursing infant with the gray-haired man.
     I said that I would scatter them afar.
    I would make their memory to cease from
    among men;
     were it not that I feared the provocation of the
    enemy,
    lest their adversaries should judge wrongly,
    lest they should say, 'Our hand is exalted;
    Yahweh has not done all this.' '
     For they are a nation void of counsel.
    There is no understanding in them.
    Oh that they were wise,that they understood this,
    that they would consider their latter end!
     How could one chase a thousand,
    and two put ten thousand to flight,
    unless their Rock had sold them,
    and Yahweh had delivered them up?
     For their rock is not as our Rock,
    even our enemies themselves concede.
     For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,
    of the fields of Gomorrah.
    Their grapes are poison grapes.
    Their clusters are bitter.
     Their wine is the poison of serpents,
    the cruel venom of asps.
     'Isn't this laid up in store with me,
    sealed up among my treasures?
     Vengeance is mine, and recompense,
    at the time when their foot slides,
    for the day of their calamity is at hand.
    Their doom rushes at them.'
     For Yahweh will judge his people,
    and have compassion on his servants,
    when he sees that their power is gone,
    that there is no one remaining, shut up or left
    at large.
     He will say, 'Where are their gods,
    the rock in which they took refuge,
     which ate the fat of their sacrifices,
    and drank the wine of their drink offering?
    Let them rise up and help you!
    Let them be your protection.
     'See now that I myself am he.
    There is no god with me.
    I kill and I make alive.
    I wound and I heal.
    There is no one who can deliver out of my
    hand.
     For I lift up my hand to heaven and declare,
    as I live forever,
     if I sharpen my glittering sword,
    my hand grasps it in judgment;
    I will take vengeance on my adversaries,
    and will repay those who hate me.
     I will make my arrows drunk with blood.
    My sword shall devour flesh with the blood of
    the slain and the captives,
    from the head of the leaders of the enemy.'
     Rejoice, you nations, with his people,
    for he will avenge the blood of his servants.
    He will take vengeance on his adversaries,
    and will make atonement for his land and for
    his people.
    Moses came and spoke all the words of this song
    in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of
    Nun.  Moses finished reciting all these words to
    all Israel.  He said to them, 'Set your heart to all
    the words which I testify to you today, which you
    shall command your children to observe to do, all
    the words of this law.  For it is no vain thing for
    you, because it is your life, and through this thing
    you shall prolong your days in the land, where you
    go over the Jordan to possess it.'
     Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,
     'Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount
    Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is across
    from Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which
    I give to the children of Israel for a possession.
     Die on the mountain where you go up, and be
    gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother
    died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people;  because you trespassed against me among
    the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of
    Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn't

      
    uphold my holiness among the children of Israel.
     For you shall see the land from a distance; but
    you shall not go there into the land which I give the
    children of Israel.'
    
    This is the blessing with which Moses the man of
    God blessed the children of Israel before his death.
     He said,
    'Yahweh came from Sinai,
    and rose from Seir to them.
    He shone from Mount Paran.
    He came from the ten thousands of holy ones.
    At his right hand was a fiery law for them.*
     Yes, he loves the people.
    All his saints are in your hand.
    They sat down at your feet.
    Each receives your words.
     Moses commanded us a law,
    an inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
     He was king in Jeshurun,
    when the heads of the people were gathered,
    all the tribes of Israel together.
     'Let Reuben live, and not die;
    Nor let his men be few.'
     This is for Judah. He said,
    'Hear, Yahweh, the voice of Judah.
    Bring him in to his people.
    With his hands he contended for himself.
    You shall be a help against his adversaries.'
     About Levi he said,
    'Your Thummim and yourUrim are with your godly
    one,
    whom you proved at Massah,
    with whom you contended at the waters of
    Meribah.
    He said of his father, and of his mother, 'I have not
    seen him.'
    He didn't acknowledge his brothers,
    nor did he know his own children;
    for they have observed your word,
    and keep your covenant.
     They shall teach Jacob your ordinances,
    and Israel your law.
    They shall put incense before you,
    and whole burnt offering on your altar.
     Yahweh, bless his skills.
    Accept the work of his hands.
    Strike through the hips of those who rise up against
    him,
    of those who hate him, that they not rise
    again.'
     About Benjamin he said,
    'The beloved of Yahweh will dwell in safety by him.
    He covers him all day long.
    He dwells between his shoulders.'
     About Joseph he said,
    'His land is blessed by Yahweh,
    for the precious things of the heavens, for the
    dew,
    for the deep that couches beneath,
     for the precious things of the fruits of the sun,
    for the precious things that the moon can
    yield,
     for the best things of the ancient mountains,
    for the precious things of the everlasting hills,
     for the precious things of the earth and its fullness,
    the good will of him who lived in the bush.
    Let this come on the head of Joseph,
    on the crown of the head of him who was
    separated from his brothers.
     Majesty belongs to the firstborn of his herd.
    His horns are the horns of the wild ox.
    With them he will push all the peoples to the
    ends of the earth.
    They are the ten thousands of Ephraim.
    They are the thousands of Manasseh.'
     About Zebulun he said,
    'Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;
    and Issachar, in your tents.
     They will call the peoples to the mountain.
    There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness,
    for they will draw out the abundance of the seas,
    the hidden treasures of the sand.'
     About Gad he said,
    'He who enlarges Gad is blessed.
    He dwells as a lioness,
    and tears the arm and the crown of the head.
     He provided the first part for himself,
    for the lawgiver's portion was reserved for
    him.
    He came with the heads of the people.
    He executed the righteousness of Yahweh,
    His ordinances with Israel.'
     About Dan he said,
    'Dan is a lion's cub
    that leaps out of Bashan.'
     About Naphtali he said,
    'Naphtali, satisfied with favor,
    full of Yahweh's blessing,
    Possess the west and the south.'
     About Asher he said,
    'Asher is blessed with children.
    Let him be acceptable to his brothers.
    Let him dip his foot in oil.
     Your bars will be iron and bronze.
    As your days, so your strength will be.
     'There is no one like God, Jeshurun,
    who rides on the heavens for your help,
    in his excellency on the skies.
     The eternal God is your dwelling place.
    Underneath are the everlasting arms.
    He thrust out the enemy from before you,
    and said, 'Destroy!'
     Israel dwells in safety,
    the fountain of Jacob alone,
    In a land of grain and new wine.
    Yes, his heavens drop down dew.
     You are happy, Israel!
    Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh,

      
    the shield of your help,
    the sword of your excellency?
    Your enemies will submit themselves to you.
    You will tread on their high places.'
    
     Moses went up from the plains of Moab to
    Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is opposite
    Jericho. Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead
    to Dan,  and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim
    and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the
    Western Sea,  and the south,* and the Plain of the
    valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, to Zoar.
    Yahweh said to him, 'This is the land which I swore
    to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'I will
    give it to your offspring.' I have caused you to see
    it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there.'
     So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there
    in the land of Moab, according to Yahweh's word.
     He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab
    opposite Beth Peor, but no man knows where his
    tomb isto this day. Moses was one hundred twenty
    years old when he died. His eye was not dim, nor
    his strength gone.  The children of Israel wept for
    Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the
    days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were
    ended.  Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit
    of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him. The
    children of Israel listened to him, and did as Yahweh
    commanded Moses.  Since then, there has not
    arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom Yahweh
    knew face to face,  in all the signs and the wonders
    which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt,to
    Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,
     and in all the mighty hand, and in all the awesome
    deeds, which Moses did in the sight of all Israel.

      
    The Book of
    Joshua:
    
     Now after the death of Moses the servant of
    Yahweh,* Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of Nun,
    Moses' servant,saying,  'Moses my servant is dead.
    Now therefore arise, go across this Jordan, you and
    all these people, to the land which I am giving
    to them, even to the children of Israel.  I have
    given you every place that the sole of your foot will
    tread on, as I told Moses.  From the wilderness
    and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river
    Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the
    great sea toward the going down of the sun,shall be
    your border.  No man will be able to stand before
    you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so
    I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you.
     'Be strong and courageous; for you shall cause
    this people to inherit the land which I swore to their
    fathers to give them.  Only be strong and very
    courageous. Be careful to observe to do according
    to all the law which Moses my servant commanded
    you. Don't turn from it to the right hand or to
    the left, that you may have good success wherever
    you go.  This book of the law shall not depart
    from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day
    and night, that you may observe to do according
    to all that is written in it; for then you shall make
    your way prosperous, and then you shall have good
    success. Haven't I commanded you? Be strong and
    courageous. Don't be afraid. Don't be dismayed, for
    Yahweh your God is with you wherever you go.'
     Then Joshua commanded the officers of the
    people, saying,  'Pass through the middle of the
    camp, and command the people, saying, 'Prepare
    food; for within three days you are to pass over this
    Jordan, to go in to possess the land which Yahweh
    your God gives you to possess.' '
     Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the
    Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,
     'Remember the word which Moses the servant of
    Yahweh commanded you,saying, 'Yahweh your God
    gives you rest, and will give you this land.  Your
    wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall
    live in the land which Moses gave you beyond the
    Jordan; but you shall pass over before your brothers
    armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help
    them  until Yahweh has given your brothers rest,
    as he has given you, and they have also possessed
    the land which Yahweh your God gives them. Then
    you shall return to the land of your possession and
    possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave
    you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.' '
     They answered Joshua, saying, 'All that you
    have commanded us we will do, and wherever you
    send us we will go.  Just as we listened to Moses
    in all things, so will we listen to you. Only may
    Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses.
     Whoever rebels against your commandment, and
    doesn't listen to your words in all that you command him shall himself be put to death. Only be
    strong and courageous.'
    
     Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men
    out of Shittim as spies, saying, 'Go, view the land,
    including Jericho.' They went and came into the
    house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and
    slept there.
     The king of Jericho was told, 'Behold,* men of
    the children of Israel came in here tonight to spy
    out the land.'
     Jericho's king sent to Rahab, saying, 'Bring out
    the men who have come to you, who have entered
    into your house; for they have come to spy out all
    the land.'
     The woman took the two men and hid them.
    Then she said, 'Yes,the men came to me, butI didn't
    know where they came from. About the time of the
    shutting of the gate, when it was dark,the men went
    out. Where the men went, I don't know. Pursue
    them quickly. You may catch up with them.'  But
    she had brought them up to the roof, and hidden
    them under the stalks of flax which she had laid in
    order on the roof.  The men pursued them along
    the way to the fords of the Jordan River. As soon as
    those who pursued them had gone out, they shut
    the gate.  Before they had lain down, she came
    up to them on the roof.  She said to the men, 'I
    know that Yahweh has given you the land, and that
    the fear of you has fallen upon us, and that all the
    inhabitants of the land melt away before you.  For
    we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of
    the Red Sea before you, when you came out of Egypt;
    and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites,
    who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og,
    whom you utterly destroyed.  As soon as we had
    heard it, our hearts melted, and there wasn't any
    more spirit in any man, because of you: for Yahweh
    your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth
    beneath.  Now therefore, please swear to me by
    Yahweh,since I have dealt kindly with you, that you
    also will deal kindly with my father's house, and
    give me a true sign;  and that you will save alive my
    father, my mother, my brothers, and my sisters, and
    all that they have, and will deliver our lives from
    death.'
     The men said to her, 'Our life for yours, if you
    don't talk about this business of ours; and it shall
    be, when Yahweh gives us the land, that we will deal
    kindly and truly with you.'
     Then she let them down by a cord through the
    window; for her house was on the side of the wall,
    and she lived on the wall.  She said to them, 'Go
    to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you. Hide
    yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have
    returned. Afterward, you may go your way.'
     The men said to her, 'We will be guiltless
    of this your oath which you've made us to swear.
     Behold, when we come into the land, tie this line

      
    of scarlet thread in the window which you used to
    let us down. Gather to yourself into the house your
    father, your mother, your brothers, and all your
    father's household.  It shall be that whoever goes
    out of the doors of your house into the street, his
    blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless.
    Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall
    be on our head, if any hand is on him.  But if
    you talk about this business of ours, then we shall
    be guiltless of your oath which you've made us to
    swear.'
     She said, 'Let it be as you have said.' She sent
    them away, and they departed. Then she tied the
    scarlet line in the window.
     They went and came to the mountain, and
    stayed there three days, until the pursuers had
    returned. The pursuers sought them all along the
    way, but didn't find them.  Then the two men
    returned, descended from the mountain, crossed
    the river, and came to Joshua the son of Nun. They
    told him all that had happened to them. They said
    to Joshua, 'Truly Yahweh has delivered all the land
    into our hands. Moreover, all the inhabitants of the
    land melt away before us.'
    
     Joshua got up early in the morning; and they
    moved from Shittim and came to the Jordan, he
    and all the children of Israel. They camped there
    before they crossed over.  After three days, the
    officers went through the middle of the camp;  and
    they commanded the people, saying, 'When you
    see the ark of Yahweh your God's covenant, and
    the Levitical priests bearing it, then leave your
    place and follow it.  Yet there shall be a space
    between you and it of about two thousand cubits*
    by measure-don't come closer to it-that you may
    know the way by which you must go; for you have
    not passed this way before.'
     Joshua said to the people, 'Sanctify yourselves;
    for tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders among you.'
     Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, 'Take up
    the ark of the covenant, and cross over before the
    people.' They took up the ark of the covenant, and
    went before the people.
     Yahweh said to Joshua, 'Today I will begin to
    magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may
    know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.
    You shall command the priests who bear the ark of
    the covenant, saying, 'When you come to the brink
    of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in
    the Jordan.' '
     Joshua said to the children of Israel, 'Come here,
    and hear the words of Yahweh your God.'  Joshua
    said, 'By this you shall know that the living God is
    among you, and that he will without fail drive the
    Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the Perizzite, the
    Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Jebusite out from
    before you.  Behold, the ark of the covenant of the
    Lord of all the earth passes over before you into
    the Jordan. Now therefore take twelve men out of
    the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.  It shall
    be that when the soles of the feet of the priests who
    bear the ark ofYahweh,the Lord of all the earth,rest
    in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the
    Jordan will be cut off. The waters that come down
    from above shall stand in one heap.'
     When the people moved from their tents to
    pass over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of
    the covenant being before the people,  and when
    those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan,
    and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had
    dipped in the edge of the water (for the Jordan
    overflows all its banks all the time of harvest),  the
    waters which came down from above stood, and
    rose up in one heap a great way off, at Adam,the city
    that is beside Zarethan; and those that went down
    toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were
    wholly cut off. Then the people passed over near
    Jericho.  The priests who bore the ark of Yahweh's
    covenant stood firm on dry ground in the middle
    of the Jordan; and all Israel crossed over on dry
    ground, until all the nation had passed completely
    over the Jordan.
    
     When all the nation had completely crossed
    over the Jordan, Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
     'Take twelve men out of the people, a man out
    of every tribe,  and command them, saying, 'Take
    from out of the middle of the Jordan, out of the place
    where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones,
    carry them over with you, and lay them down in the
    place where you'll camp tonight.' '
     Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he
    had prepared of the children of Israel, a man out
    of every tribe.  Joshua said to them, 'Cross before
    the ark of Yahweh your God into the middle of the
    Jordan, and each of you pick up a stone and put it
    on your shoulder, according to the number of the
    tribes of the children of Israel;  that this may be a
    sign among you, that when your children ask in the
    future,saying, 'What do you mean by these stones?'
     then you shall tell them, 'Because the waters of
    the Jordan were cut off before the ark of Yahweh's
    covenant. When it crossed over the Jordan, the
    waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones shall
    be for a memorial to the children of Israel forever.' '
    The children of Israel did asJoshua commanded,
    and took up twelve stones out of the middle of the
    Jordan, as Yahweh spoke to Joshua, according to the
    number of the tribes of the children of Israel. They
    carried them over with them to the place where
    they camped, and laid them down there.  Joshua
    set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan,
    in the place where the feet of the priests who bore
    the ark of the covenant stood; and they are there
    to this day.  For the priests who bore the ark
    stood in the middle of the Jordan until everything
    was finished that Yahweh commanded Joshua to
    speak to the people, according to all that Moses
    commanded Joshua; and the people hurried and
    passed over.  When all the people had completely

      
    crossed over, Yahweh's ark crossed over with the
    priests in the presence of the people.
     The children of Reuben, and the children of
    Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over
    armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke
    to them.  About forty thousand men, ready and
    armed for war, passed over before Yahweh to battle,
    to the plains of Jericho.  On that day, Yahweh
    magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they
    feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his
    life.
     Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,  'Command
    the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, that
    they come up out of the Jordan.'
     Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, 'Come up out of the Jordan!'  When the
    priests who bore the ark of Yahweh's covenant had
    come up out of the middle of the Jordan, and the
    soles of the priests' feet had been lifted up to the dry
    ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their
    place, and went over all its banks, as before.  The
    people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day
    of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the
    east border of Jericho.
     Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they
    took out of the Jordan, in Gilgal.  He spoke to the
    children of Israel, saying, 'When your children ask
    their fathers in time to come,saying, 'What do these
    stones mean?'  Then you shall let your children
    know, saying, 'Israel came over this Jordan on dry
    land.  For Yahweh your God dried up the waters
    of the Jordan from before you until you had crossed
    over, as Yahweh your God did to the Red Sea, which
    he dried up from before us, until we had crossed
    over,  that all the peoples of the earth may know
    that Yahweh's hand is mighty, and that you may
    fear Yahweh your God forever.' '
    
     When all the kings of the Amorites, who were
    beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of
    the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how
    Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan from
    before the children of Israel until we had crossed
    over, their heart melted, and there was no more
    spirit in them, because of the children of Israel.
     At that time, Yahweh said to Joshua, 'Make flint
    knives, and circumcise again the sons of Israel the
    second time.'  Joshua made himself flint knives,
    and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the
    foreskins.  This is the reason Joshua circumcised
    them: all the people who came out of Egypt, who
    were males, even all the men of war, died in the
    wilderness along the way, after they came out of
    Egypt.  For all the people who came out were
    circumcised; but all the people who were born in
    the wilderness along the way as they came out of
    Egypt had not been circumcised.  For the children
    of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness until
    all the nation, even the men of war who came out
    of Egypt, were consumed, because they didn't listen
    to Yahweh's voice. Yahweh swore to them that he
    wouldn't let them see the land which Yahweh swore
    to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing
    with milk and honey.  Their children, whom he
    raised up in their place, were circumcised by Joshua,
    for they were uncircumcised, because they had not
    circumcised them on the way.  When they were
    done circumcising the whole nation, they stayed in
    their places in the camp until they were healed.
     Yahweh said to Joshua, 'Today I have rolled
    away the reproach of Egypt from you.' Therefore
    the name of that place was called Gilgal* to this
    day.  The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal.
    They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of
    the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.
     They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of
    the produce of the land on the next day after the
    Passover, in the same day.  The manna ceased on
    the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of
    the land. The children of Israel didn't have manna
    any more, but they ate of the fruit of the land of
    Canaan that year.
     When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his
    eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front
    of him with his sword drawn in his hand. Joshua
    went to him and said to him, 'Are you for us, or for
    our enemies?'
    He said, 'No; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh's army.'
    Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and asked him, 'What does my lord say to
    his servant?'
     The prince of Yahweh's army said to Joshua,
    'Take off your sandals, for the place on which you
    stand is holy.' Joshua did so.
    
     Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the
    children of Israel. No one went out, and no one
    came in.  Yahweh said to Joshua, 'Behold, I have
    given Jericho into your hand, with its king and the
    mighty men of valor.  All of your men of war
    shall march around the city, going around the city
    once. You shall do this six days.  Seven priests
    shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the
    ark. On the seventh day, you shall march around
    the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the
    trumpets.  It shall be that when they make a long
    blast with the ram's horn, and when you hear the
    sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with
    a great shout; then the city wall will fall down flat,
    and the people shall go up, every man straight in
    front of him.'
     Joshua the son ofNun called the priests, and said
    to them, 'Take up the ark of the covenant, and let
    seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns
    before Yahweh's ark.'
     They said to the people, 'Advance! March
    around the city, and let the armed men pass on
    before Yahweh's ark.'
     It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to
    the people, the seven priests bearing the seven
    trumpets of rams' horns before Yahweh advanced
    and blew the trumpets, and the ark of Yahweh's
    covenant followed them.  The armed men went

      
    before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the
    ark went after them. The trumpets sounded  as the y
    went.
     Joshua commanded the people, saying, 'You
    shall not shout nor let your voice be heard, neither
    shall any word proceed out of your mouth until
    the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.'
     So he caused Yahweh's ark to go around the city,
    circling it once. Then they came into the camp,
    and stayed in the camp.  Joshua rose early in
    the morning, and the priests took up Yahweh's ark.
     The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets
    of rams' horns in front of Yahweh's ark went on
    continually, and blew the trumpets. The armed
    men went in front of them. The rear guard came
    after Yahweh's ark. The trumpets sounded as they
    went.  The second day they marched around the
    city once, and returned into the camp. They did this
    six days.
     On the seventh day, they rose early at the
    dawning of the day, and marched around the city
    in the same way seven times. On this day only
    they marched around the city seven times. At the
    seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets,
    Joshua said to the people, 'Shout, for Yahweh has
    given you the city! The city shall be devoted, even
    it and all that is in it, to Yahweh. Only Rahab the
    prostitute shall live, she and all who are with her in
    the house, because she hid the messengers that we
    sent.  But as for you, only keep yourselves from
    what is devoted to destruction, lest when you have
    devoted it, you take of the devoted thing; so you
    would make the camp of Israel accursed and trouble
    it.  But all the silver, gold, and vessels of bronze
    and iron are holy to Yahweh. They shall come into
    Yahweh's treasury.'
     So the people shouted and the priests blew the
    trumpets. When the people heard the sound of the
    trumpet, the people shouted with a great shout, and
    the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up
    into the city, every man straight in front of him,
    and they took the city.  They utterly destroyed
    all that was in the city, both man and woman, both
    young and old, and ox, sheep, and donkey, with the
    edge of the sword.  Joshua said to the two men
    who had spied out the land, 'Go into the prostitute's
    house, and bring the woman and all that she has out
    from there, as you swore to her.'  The young men
    who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab with
    her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that
    she had. They also brought out all of her relatives,
    and they set them outside of the camp of Israel.
     They burned the city with fire, and all that was in
    it. Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels
    of bronze and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh's
    house.  But Rahab the prostitute, her father's
    household, and all that she had, Joshua saved alive.
    She lives in the middle of Israel to this day, because
    she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out
    Jericho.
     Joshua commanded them with an oath at that
    time, saying, 'Cursed is the man before Yahweh
    who rises up and builds this city Jericho. With the
    loss of his firstborn he will lay its foundation, and
    with the loss of his youngest son he will set up its
    gates.'  So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame
    was in all the land.
    
     But the children of Israel committed a trespass
    in the devoted things; for Achan, the son of Carmi,
    the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of
    Judah, took some of the devoted things. Therefore
    Yahweh's anger burned against the children of Israel.  Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which
    is beside Beth Aven, on the east side of Bethel, and
    spoke to them,saying, 'Go up and spy out the land.'
    The men went up and spied out Ai.  They
    returned to Joshua, and said to him, 'Don't let
    all the people go up, but let about two or three
    thousand men go up and strike Ai. Don't make all
    the people to toil there, for there are only a few
    of them.'  So about three thousand men of the
    people went up there, and they fled before the men
    of Ai.  The men of Ai struck about thirty-six men of
    them. They chased them from before the gate even
    to Shebarim, and struck them at the descent. The
    hearts of the people melted, and became like water.
     Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on
    his face before Yahweh's ark until the evening, he
    and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their
    heads.  Joshua said, 'Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have
    you brought this people over the Jordan at all, to
    deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to cause us
    to perish? I wish that we had been content and lived
    beyond the Jordan! Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after
    Israel has turned their backs before their enemies?
     For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the
    land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off
    our name from the earth. What will you do for your
    great name?'
     Yahweh said to Joshua, 'Get up! Why have you
    fallen on your face like that?  Israel has sinned.
    Yes, they have even transgressed my covenant
    which I commanded them. Yes, they have even
    taken some of the devoted things, and have also
    stolen, and also deceived. They have even put it
    among their own stuff.  Therefore the children
    of Israel can't stand before their enemies. They
    turn their backs before their enemies, because they
    have become devoted for destruction. I will not be
    with you any more, unless you destroy the devoted
    things from among you. Get up! Sanctify the people, and say, 'Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, for
    Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, 'There is a devoted
    thing among you, Israel. You cannot stand before
    your enemies until you take away the devoted thing
    from among you.'  In the morning therefore you
    shall be brought near by your tribes. It shall be
    that the tribe which Yahweh selects shall come near
    by families. The family which Yahweh selects shall
    come near by households. The household which
    Yahweh selects shall come near man by man.  It
    shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing
    shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has,
    because he has transgressed Yahweh's covenant,
    and because he has done a disgraceful thing in
    Israel.' '
      
     So Joshua rose up early in the morning and
    brought Israel near by their tribes. The tribe of
    Judah was selected. He brought near the family of
    Judah, and he selected the family of the Zerahites.
    He brought near the family of the Zerahites man by
    man, and Zabdi was selected.  He brought near
    his household man by man, and Achan, the son of
    Carmi,the son of Zabdi,the son of Zerah, of the tribe
    of Judah, was selected.  Joshua said to Achan, 'My
    son, please give glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel,
    and make confession to him. Tell me now what you
    have done! Don't hide it from me!'
     Achan answered Joshua, and said, 'I have truly
    sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and this is
    what I have done.  When I saw among the plunder
    a beautiful Babylonian robe, two hundred shekels*
    of silver, and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels,
    then I coveted them and took them. Behold, they
    are hidden in the ground in the middle of my tent,
    with the silver under it.'
     So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the
    tent. Behold, it was hidden in his tent, with the
    silver under it.  They took them from the middle
    of the tent, and brought them to Joshua and to all
    the children of Israel. They laid them down before
    Yahweh.  Joshua, and all Israel with him, took
    Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the
    wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his cattle,
    his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had;
    and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.
     Joshua said, 'Why have you troubled us? Yahweh
    will trouble you today.' All Israel stoned him with
    stones, and they burned them with fire and stoned
    them with stones.  They raised over him a great
    heap of stones that remains to this day. Yahweh
    turned from the fierceness of his anger. Therefore
    the name of that place was called 'The valley of
    Achor' to this day.
    
     Yahweh said to Joshua, 'Don't be afraid, and
    don't be dismayed. Take all the warriors with you,
    and arise, go up to Ai. Behold, I have given into your
    hand the king of Ai, with his people, his city, and his
    land.  You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to
    Jericho and her king, except you shall take its goods
    and its livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush for
    the city behind it.'
    So Joshua arose, with all the warriors,to go up to
    Ai. Joshua chose thirty thousand men, the mighty
    men of valor, and sent them out by night.  He
    commanded them, saying, 'Behold, you shall lie in
    ambush against the city, behind the city. Don't go
    very far from the city, but all of you be ready.  I and
    all the people who are with me will approach the
    city. It shall happen, when they come out against
    us, as at the first, that we will flee before them.
     They will come out after us until we have drawn
    them away from the city; for they will say, 'They flee
    before us, like the first time.' So we will flee before
    them,  and you shall rise up from the ambush, and
    take possession of the city; for Yahweh your God will
    deliver it into your hand.  It shall be, when you
    have seized the city, that you shall set the city on
    fire. You shall do this according to Yahweh's word.
    Behold, I have commanded you.'
     Joshua sent them out; and they went to set up
    the ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai on
    the west side of Ai; but Joshua stayed among the
    people that night.  Joshua rose up early in the
    morning, mustered the people, and went up, he and
    the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.  All
    the people, even the men of war who were with
    him, went up and came near, and came before the
    city and encamped on the north side of Ai. Now
    there was a valley between him and Ai.  He took
    about five thousand men, and set them in ambush
    between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
     So they set the people, even all the army who
    was on the north of the city, and their ambush on
    the west of the city; and Joshua went that night
    into the middle of the valley.  When the king of
    Ai saw it, they hurried and rose up early, and the
    men of the city went out against Israel to battle,
    he and all his people, at the time appointed, before
    the Arabah; but he didn't know that there was an
    ambush against him behind the city.  Joshua and
    all Israel made as if they were beaten before them,
    and fled by the way of the wilderness.  All the
    people who were in the city were called together to
    pursue after them. They pursued Joshua, and were
    drawn away from the city.  There was not a man
    left in Ai or Bethel who didn't go out after Israel.
    They left the city open, and pursued Israel.
     Yahweh said to Joshua, 'Stretch out the javelin
    that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into
    your hand.'
    Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his
    hand toward the city.  The ambush arose quickly
    out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had
    stretched out his hand and entered into the city
    and took it. They hurried and set the city on fire.
     When the men of Ai looked behind them, they
    saw, and behold, the smoke of the city ascended up
    to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way
    or that way. The people who fled to the wilderness
    turned back on the pursuers.  When Joshua and
    all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city,
    and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they
    turned back and killed the men of Ai.  The others
    came out of the city against them, so they were in
    the middle of Israel, some on this side, and some on
    that side. They struck them,so that they let none of
    them remain or escape. They captured the king of
    Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua.
     When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which
    they pursued them, and they had all fallen by the
    edge of the sword until they were consumed, all
    Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of
    the sword.  All that fell that day, both of men
    and women, were twelve thousand, even all the
    people of Ai.  For Joshua didn't draw back his
    hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until
    he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
     Israel took for themselves only the livestock and
    * : A shekel is about  grams or about . ounces.
      
    the goods of that city, according to Yahweh's word
    which he commanded Joshua.  So Joshua burned
    Ai and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, to
    this day.  He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until
    the evening. At sundown, Joshua commanded, and
    they took his body down from the tree and threw it
    at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised a
    great heap of stones on it that remains to this day.
     Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God
    of Israel, on Mount Ebal,  as Moses the servant of
    Yahweh commanded the children of Israel, as it is
    written in the book of the law of Moses: an altar
    of uncut stones, on which no one had lifted up any
    iron. They offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh
    and sacrificed peace offerings. He wrote there on
    the stones a copy of Moses' law, which he wrote in
    the presence of the children of Israel.  All Israel,
    with their elders, officers, and judges,stood on both
    sides of the ark before the Levitical priests, who
    carried the ark of Yahweh's covenant, the foreigner
    as well as the native; half of them in front of Mount
    Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal,
    as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded
    at the first, that they should bless the people of
    Israel.  Afterward he read all the words of the law,
    the blessing and the curse, according to all that is
    written in the book of the law.  There was not a
    word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua
    didn't read before all the assembly ofIsrael, with the
    women, the little ones, and the foreigners who were
    among them.
    
    When all the kings who were beyond the Jordan,
    in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the
    shore of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the
    Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard of it  they gathered
    themselves together to fight with Joshua and with
    Israel, with one accord.  But when the inhabitants
    of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho
    and to Ai,  they also resorted to a ruse, and went
    and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took
    old sacks on their donkeys, and old, torn-up and
    bound up wine skins,  and old and patched sandals
    on their feet, and wore old garments. All the bread
    of their food supply was dry and moldy.  They
    went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, and said to him
    and to the men of Israel, 'We have come from a far
    country. Now therefore make a covenant with us.'
     The men of Israel said to the Hivites, 'What if
    you live among us? How could we make a covenant
    with you?'
     They said to Joshua, 'We are your servants.'
    Joshua said to them, 'Who are you? Where do you
    come from?'
     They said to him, 'Your servants have come
    from a very far country because of the name of
    Yahweh your God; for we have heard of his fame,
    all that he did in Egypt,  and all that he did to
    the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the
    Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon and to Og king of
    Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.  Our elders and all
    the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying,
    'Take supplies in your hand for the journey, and go
    to meet them. Tell them, 'We are your servants.
    Now make a covenant with us.' '  This our bread
    we took hot for our supplies out of our houses on
    the day we went out to go to you; but now, behold,
    it is dry, and has become moldy.  These wine
    skins, which we filled, were new; and behold, they
    are torn. These our garments and our sandals have
    become old because of the very long journey.'
     The men sampled their provisions, and didn't
    ask counsel from Yahweh's mouth.  Joshua made
    peace with them, and made a covenant with them,
    to let them live. The princes of the congregation
    swore to them.  At the end of three days after
    they had made a covenant with them, they heard
    that they were their neighbors, and that they lived
    among them.  The children of Israel traveled and
    came to their cities on the third day. Now their
    cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath
    Jearim.  The children of Israel didn't strike them,
    because the princes of the congregation had sworn
    to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel. All the
    congregation murmured against the princes.  But
    all the princes said to all the congregation, 'We have
    sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel. Now
    therefore we may not touch them.  We will do
    this to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on
    us, because of the oath which we swore to them.'
     The princes said to them, 'Let them live.' So
    they became wood cutters and drawers of water for
    all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to
    them.
     Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them,
    saying, 'Why have you deceived us, saying, 'We are
    very far from you,' when you live among us? Now
    therefore you are cursed, and some of you will never
    fail to be slaves, both wood cutters and drawers of
    water for the house of my God.'
    They answered Joshua, and said, 'Because your
    servants were certainly told how Yahweh your God
    commanded his servant Moses to give you all the
    land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land
    from before you. Therefore we were very afraid for
    our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
     Now, behold, we are in your hand. Do to us as it
    seems good and right to you to do.'
     He did so to them, and delivered them out of
    the hand of the children of Israel,so that they didn't
    kill them.  That day Joshua made them wood
    cutters and drawers of water for the congregation
    and for Yahweh's altar to this day, in the place
    which he should choose.
    
    Now when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard
    how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed
    it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had
    done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of
    Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among
    them,  they were very afraid, because Gibeon was a
    great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it
    was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.
     Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to
    Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth,
      
    Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon,
    saying,  'Come up to me and help me. Let's strike
    Gibeon; for they have made peace with Joshua and
    with the children of Israel.'  Therefore the five
    kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the
    king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of
    Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered themselves
    together and went up, they and all their armies, and
    encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.
     The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp at
    Gilgal, saying, 'Don't abandon your servants! Come
    up to us quickly and save us! Help us; for all the
    kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country
    have gathered together against us.'
     So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and the whole
    army with him, including all the mighty men of
    valor. Yahweh said to Joshua, 'Don't fear them, for
    I have delivered them into your hands. Not a man
    of them will stand before you.'
     Joshua therefore came to them suddenly. He
    marched from Gilgal all night.  Yahweh confused
    them before Israel. He killed them with a great
    slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way
    of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to
    Azekah and to Makkedah.  As they fled from
    before Israel, while they were at the descent of
    Beth Horon, Yahweh hurled down great stones from
    the sky on them to Azekah, and they died. There
    were more who died from the hail stones than those
    whom the children of Israel killed with the sword.
     Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh in the day when
    Yahweh delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel. He said in the sight of Israel, 'Sun,
    stand still on Gibeon! You, moon, stop in the valley
    of Aijalon!'
     The sun stood still, and the moon stayed,
    until the nation had avenged themselves of their
    enemies. Isn't this written in the book of Jashar?
    The sun stayed in the middle of the sky, and didn't
    hurry to go down about a whole day.  There was
    no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh
    listened to the voice of a man; for Yahweh fought
    for Israel.
     Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to
    the camp to Gilgal.  These five kings fled, and
    hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.  Joshua
    was told, saying, 'The five kings have been found,
    hidden in the cave at Makkedah.'
     Joshua said, 'Roll large stones to cover the
    cave's entrance, and set men by it to guard them;
     but don't stay there. Pursue your enemies, and
    attack them from the rear. Don't allow them to
    enter into their cities; for Yahweh your God has
    delivered them into your hand.'
     When Joshua and the children of Israel had
    finished killing them with a very great slaughter
    until they were consumed, and the remnant which
    remained of them had entered into the fortified
    cities,  all the people returned to the camp to
    Joshua at Makkedah in peace. None moved his
    tongue against any of the children of Israel.  Then
    Joshua said, 'Open the cave entrance, and bring
    those five kings out of the cave to me.'
     They did so, and brought those five kings out
    of the cave to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king
    of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish,
    and the king of Eglon.  When they brought those
    kings out to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of
    Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who
    went with him, 'Come near. Put your feet on the
    necks of these kings.'
    They came near, and put their feet on their necks.
     Joshua said to them, 'Don't be afraid, nor be
    dismayed. Be strong and courageous, for Yahweh
    will do this to all your enemies against whom you
    fight.'
     Afterward Joshua struck them, put them to
    death, and hanged them on five trees. They were
    hanging on the trees until the evening.  At the
    time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and
    threw them into the cave in which they had hidden
    themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of
    the cave, which remain to this very day.
     Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck
    it with the edge of the sword, with its king. He
    utterly destroyed it and all the souls who were in
    it. He left no one remaining. He did to the king of
    Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
     Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel
    with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah.
     Yahweh delivered it also, with its king, into the
    hand of Israel. He struck it with the edge of the
    sword, and all the souls who were in it. He left no
    one remaining in it. He did to its king as he had done
    to the king of Jericho.
     Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with
    him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and
    fought against it.  Yahweh delivered Lachish into
    the hand of Israel. He took it on the second day, and
    struck it with the edge of the sword, with all the
    souls who were in it, according to all that he had
    done to Libnah.  Then Horam king of Gezer came
    up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his
    people, until he had left him no one remaining.
     Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with
    him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it and
    fought against it.  They took it on that day, and
    struck it with the edge of the sword. He utterly
    destroyed all the souls who were in it that day,
    according to all that he had done to Lachish.
     Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with
    him, to Hebron; and they fought against it.  They
    took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword,
    with its king and all its cities, and all the souls who
    were in it. He left no one remaining, according to all
    that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed
    it, and all the souls who were in it.
     Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to
    Debir, and fought against it.  He took it, with
    its king and all its cities. They struck them with
    the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the
    souls who were in it. He left no one remaining. As
    he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its
    king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king.
     So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, the
    South, the lowland, the slopes, and all their kings.
      
    He left no one remaining, but he utterly destroyed
    all that breathed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel,
    commanded.  Joshua struck them from Kadesh
    Barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen,
    even to Gibeon.  Joshua took all these kings and
    their land at one time because Yahweh, the God of
    Israel, fought for Israel.  Joshua returned, and all
    Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
    
     When Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, he sent
    to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to
    the king of Achshaph,  and to the kings who were
    on the north, in the hill country, in the Arabah
    south of Chinneroth, in the lowland, and in the
    heights of Dor on the west,  to the Canaanite on the
    east and on the west, the Amorite, the Hittite, the
    Perizzite, the Jebusite in the hill country, and the
    Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.  They
    went out, they and all their armies with them, many
    people, even as the sand that is on the seashore
    in multitude, with very many horses and chariots.
     All these kings met together; and they came and
    encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight
    with Israel.
     Yahweh said to Joshua, 'Don't be afraid because
    of them; for tomorrow at this time, I will deliver
    them up all slain before Israel. You shall hamstring
    their horses and burn their chariots with fire.'
     So Joshua came suddenly, with all the warriors,
    against them by the waters of Merom, and attacked
    them.  Yahweh delivered them into the hand of
    Israel, and they struck them, and chased them to
    great Sidon, and to Misrephoth Maim, and to the
    valley of Mizpah eastward. They struck them until
    they left them no one remaining.  Joshua did to
    them as Yahweh told him. He hamstrung their
    horses and burned their chariots with fire.  Joshua
    turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck
    its king with the sword; for Hazor used to be the
    head of all those kingdoms.  They struck all the
    souls who were in it with the edge of the sword,
    utterly destroying them. There was no one left who
    breathed. He burned Hazor with fire.  Joshua
    captured all the cities of those kings, with their
    kings, and he struck them with the edge of the
    sword, and utterly destroyed them, as Moses the
    servant of Yahweh commanded.  But as for the
    cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned
    none of them, except Hazor only. Joshua burned
    that.  The children of Israel took all the plunder
    of these cities, with the livestock, as plunder for
    themselves; but every man they struck with the
    edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them.
    They didn't leave any who breathed.
     As Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so
    Moses commanded Joshua. Joshua did so. He left
    nothing undone of all that Yahweh commanded
    Moses.  So Joshua captured all that land, the hill
    country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the
    lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel, and
    the lowland of the same,  from Mount Halak, that
    goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad in the valley of
    Lebanon under Mount Hermon. He took all their
    kings,struck them, and put them to death.  Joshua
    made war a long time with all those kings.  There
    was not a city that made peace with the children of
    Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon.
    They took all in battle.  For it was of Yahweh to
    harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle,
    that he might utterly destroy them, that they might
    have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as
    Yahweh commanded Moses.  Joshua came at that
    time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill country,
    from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from
    all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill
    country of Israel. Joshua utterly destroyed them
    with their cities.  There were none of the Anakim
    left in the land of the children of Israel. Only in
    Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.  So
    Joshua took the whole land, according to all that
    Yahweh spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an
    inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by
    their tribes. Then the land had rest from war.
    
     Now these are the kings of the land, whom the
    children of Israel struck, and possessed their land
    beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, from the
    valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the
    Arabah eastward:  Sihon king of the Amorites, who
    lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on
    the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the middle
    of the valley, and half Gilead, even to the river
    Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;  and
    the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and
    to the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward,
    the way to Beth Jeshimoth; and on the south, under
    the slopes of Pisgah:  and the border of Og king of
    Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived
    at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,  and ruled in Mount
    Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, to the
    border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and
    half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
     Moses the servant of Yahweh and the children of
    Israel struck them. Moses the servant of Yahweh
    gave it for a possession to the Reubenites, and the
    Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
     These are the kings of the land whom Joshua
    and the children of Israel struck beyond the Jordan
    westward, from Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon
    even to Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir. Joshua
    gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;  in the hill country, and in
    the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes,
    and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite,
    the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the
    Hivite, and the Jebusite:
     the king of Jericho, one;
    the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
     the king of Jerusalem, one;
    the king of Hebron, one;
     the king of Jarmuth, one;
    the king of Lachish, one;
     the king of Eglon, one;
    the king of Gezer, one;
     the king of Debir, one;
    the king of Geder, one;
      
     the king of Hormah, one;
    the king of Arad, one;
     the king of Libnah, one;
    the king of Adullam, one;
     the king of Makkedah, one;
    the king of Bethel, one;
     the king of Tappuah, one;
    the king of Hepher, one;
     the king of Aphek, one;
    the king of Lassharon, one;
     the king of Madon, one;
    the king of Hazor, one;
     the king of Shimron Meron, one;
    the king of Achshaph, one;
     the king of Taanach, one;
    the king of Megiddo, one;
     the king of Kedesh, one;
    the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
     the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one;
    the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;
     the king of Tirzah, one:
    all the kings thirty-one.
    
    Now Joshua was old and well advanced in years.
    Yahweh said to him, 'You are old and advanced in
    years, and there remains yet very much land to be
    possessed.
     'This is the land that still remains: all the
    regions of the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;
     from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to
    the border of Ekron northward, which is counted
    as Canaanite; the five lords of the Philistines; the
    Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the
    Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avvim,  on
    the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and
    Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to
    the border of the Amorites;  and the land of the
    Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise, from
    Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of
    Hamath;  all the inhabitants of the hill country
    from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, even all the
    Sidonians. I will drive them out from before the
    children of Israel. Just allocate it to Israel for an
    inheritance, as I have commanded you.  Now
    therefore divide this land for an inheritance to
    the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.'
     With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received
    their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond
    the Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of
    Yahweh gave them:  from Aroer, that is on the
    edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that
    is in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of
    Medeba to Dibon;  and all the cities of Sihon king
    of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the
    border of the children of Ammon;  and Gilead,
    and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites,
    and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah;
     all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned
    in Ashtaroth and in Edrei (who was left of the
    remnant of the Rephaim); for Moses attacked these,
    and drove them out.  Nevertheless the children
    of Israel didn't drive out the Geshurites, nor the
    Maacathites: but Geshur and Maacath live within
    Israel to this day.  Only he gave no inheritance
    to the tribe of Levi. The offerings of Yahweh, the
    God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance, as
    he spoke to him.  Moses gave to the tribe of
    the children of Reuben according to their families.
     Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge
    of the valley of the Arnon, and the city that is in the
    middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;
     Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain;
    Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,  Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,  Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth
    Shahar in the mount of the valley,  Beth Peor, the
    slopes of Pisgah, Beth Jeshimoth,  all the cities of
    the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the
    Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses
    struck with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur,
    Hur, and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the
    land.  The children of Israel also killed Balaam the
    son of Beor, the soothsayer, with the sword, among
    the rest of their slain.
     The border of the children of Reuben was the
    bank of the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the
    children of Reuben according to their families, the
    cities and its villages.
     Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the children
    of Gad, according to their families.  Their border
    was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the
    land of the children of Ammon, to Aroerthat is near
    Rabbah;  and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh,
    and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border
    of Debir;  and in the valley, Beth Haram, Beth
    Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, the Jordan's bank, to
    the uttermost part of the sea of Chinnereth beyond
    the Jordan eastward.  This is the inheritance of
    the children of Gad according to their families, the
    cities and its villages.
     Moses gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of
    Manasseh. It was for the half-tribe of the children
    of Manasseh according to their families.  Their
    border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the
    kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the villages of
    Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities. Half Gilead,
    Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of
    Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir the
    son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children
    of Machir according to their families.
     These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at
    Jericho, eastward.  But Moses gave no inheritance
    to the tribe of Levi. Yahweh, the God of Israel, is
    their inheritance, as he spoke to them.
    
     These are the inheritances which the children
    of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar
    the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads
    of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the children
    of Israel, distributed to them,  by the lot of their
    inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses, for
    the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.  For Moses
    had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the
    half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but to the Levites he
    gave no inheritance among them.  For the children
      
    of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim.
    They gave no portion to the Levites in the land,
    except cities to dwell in, with their pasture lands for
    their livestock and for their property. The children
    ofIsrael did as Yahweh commanded Moses, and they
    divided the land.
     Then the children of Judah came near to Joshua
    in Gilgal. Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite
    said to him, 'You know the thing that Yahweh spoke
    to Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.  I was forty years old
    when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent me from
    Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land. I brought him
    word again asit was in my heart. Nevertheless, my
    brothers who went up with me made the heart of
    the people melt; but I wholly followed Yahweh my
    God.  Moses swore on that day, saying, 'Surely the
    land where you walked shall be an inheritance to
    you and to your children forever, because you have
    wholly followed Yahweh my God.'
     'Now, behold, Yahweh has kept me alive, as
    he spoke, these forty-five years, from the time
    that Yahweh spoke this word to Moses, while Israel
    walked in the wilderness. Now, behold, I am eighty-five years old, today. As yetI am as strong today as
    I was in the day that Moses sent me. As my strength
    was then, even so is my strength now for war, to
    go out and to come in.  Now therefore give me
    this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke in that
    day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were
    there, and great and fortified cities. It may be that
    Yahweh will be with me, and I shall drive them out,
    as Yahweh said.'
     Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to
    Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
     Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of
    Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this
    day, because he followed Yahweh, the God of Israel
    wholeheartedly.  Now the name of Hebron before
    was Kiriath Arba, after the greatest man among the
    Anakim. Then the land had rest from war.
    
     The lot for the tribe of the children of Judah
    according to their families was to the border of
    Edom, even to the wilderness of Zin southward,
    at the uttermost part of the south.  Their south
    border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea,
    from the bay that looks southward;  and it went out
    southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed
    along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh
    Barnea, and passed along by Hezron, went up to
    Addar, and turned toward Karka;  and it passed
    along to Azmon, went out at the brook of Egypt; and
    the border ended at the sea. This shall be your south
    border.  The east border was the Salt Sea, even
    to the end of the Jordan. The border of the north
    quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of
    the Jordan.  The border went up to Beth Hoglah,
    and passed along by the north of Beth Arabah; and
    the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son
    of Reuben.  The border went up to Debir from the
    valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward
    Gilgal, that faces the ascent of Adummim, which is
    on the south side of the river. The border passed
    along to the waters of En Shemesh, and ended at En
    Rogel.  The border went up by the valley of the son
    of Hinnom to the side of the Jebusite (also called
    Jerusalem) southward; and the border went up to
    the top of the mountain that lies before the valley
    of Hinnom westward, which is at the farthest part
    of the valley of Rephaim northward.  The border
    extended from the top of the mountain to the spring
    of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the
    cities of Mount Ephron; and the border extended to
    Baalah (also called Kiriath Jearim);  and the border
    turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir,
    and passed along to the side of Mount Jearim (also
    called Chesalon) on the north, and went down to
    Beth Shemesh, and passed along by Timnah;  and
    the border went out to the side of Ekron northward;
    and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed
    along to Mount Baalah, and went out atJabneel; and
    the goings out of the border were at the sea.  The
    west border was to the shore of the great sea. This
    is the border of the children of Judah according to
    their families.
    He gave to Caleb the son ofJephunneh a portion
    among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of Yahweh to Joshua, even Kiriath Arba,
    named after the father of Anak (also called Hebron).
     Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak: Sheshai,
    and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. He
    went up against the inhabitants of Debir: now the
    name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.  Caleb
    said, 'He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it,
    to him I will give Achsah my daughter as wife.'
     Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb,
    took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter as
    wife.  When she came, she had him ask her father
    for a field. She got off her donkey, and Caleb said,
    'What do you want?'
     She said, 'Give me a blessing. Because you have
    set me in the land of the South, give me also springs
    of water.'
    So he gave her the upper springs and the lower
    springs.
     This is the inheritance of the tribe of the
    children of Judah according to their families.  The
    farthest cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
    toward the border of Edom in the South were
    Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,  Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
     Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,  Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,
     Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth Hezron (also called Hazor),  Amam, Shema, Moladah,  Hazar Gaddah, Heshmon, Beth Pelet,  Hazar Shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah,  Baalah, Iim, Ezem,  Eltolad,
    Chesil, Hormah,  Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah,
     Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon. All the cities
    are twenty-nine, with their villages.
     In the lowland, Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah, Zanoah,
    En Gannim, Tappuah, Enam,  Jarmuth, Adullam,

     Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal Gad,  Dilean, Mizpah,
    Joktheel,  Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon,  Cabbon, Lah-

    and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages.
     Libnah, Ether, Ashan,  Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib,
     Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with
    their villages.
     Ekron, with its towns and its villages;  from
    Ekron even to the sea, all that were by the side of
    Ashdod, with their villages. Ashdod, itstowns and
    its villages; Gaza, its towns and its villages; to the
    brook of Egypt, and the great sea with its coastline.
     In the hill country, Shamir, Jattir, Socoh,
     Dannah, Kiriath Sannah (which is Debir),  Anab,
    Eshtemoh, Anim,  Goshen, Holon, and Giloh;

     Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En Gedi; six cities
    with their villages.
     As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of
    Jerusalem, the children of Judah couldn't drive
    them out; but the Jebusites live with the children of
    Judah at Jerusalem to this day.
    
     The lot came out for the children of Joseph
    from the Jordan at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho
    on the east, even the wilderness, going up from
    Jericho through the hill country to Bethel.  It went
    out from Bethel to Luz, and passed along to the
    border of the Archites to Ataroth;  and it went
    down westward to the border of the Japhletites, to
    the border of BethHoron the lower, and on to Gezer;
    and ended at the sea.
     The children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim,
    took their inheritance.  This was the border of the
    children of Ephraim according to their families. The
    border of their inheritance eastward was Ataroth
    Addar, to Beth Horon the upper.  The border went
    out westward at Michmethath on the north. The
    border turned about eastward to Taanath Shiloh,
    and passed along it on the east of Janoah.  It went
    down from Janoah to Ataroth, to Naarah, reached
    to Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.  From
    Tappuah the border went along westward to the
    brook of Kanah; and ended at the sea. This is the
    inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim
    according to theirfamilies;  together with the cities
    which were set apart for the children of Ephraim
    in the middle of the inheritance of the children of
    Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.  They
    didn't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer;
    but the Canaanites dwell in the territory of Ephraim
    to this day, and have become servants to do forced
    labor.
    
     This was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh,
    for he was the firstborn of Joseph. As for Machir
    the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead,
    because he was a man of war, therefore he had
    Gilead and Bashan.  So this was for the rest of the
    children of Manasseh according to their families:
    for the children of Abiezer, for the children of
    Helek, for the children of Asriel, for the children of
    Shechem, for the children of Hepher, and for the
    children of Shemida. These were the male children
    of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their
    families.  But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher,
    the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of
    Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters. These are
    the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah,
    Milcah, and Tirzah.  They came to Eleazar the
    priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the
    princes,saying, 'Yahweh commanded Moses to give
    us an inheritance among our brothers.' Therefore
    according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave
    them an inheritance among the brothers of their
    father.  Ten parts fell to Manasseh, in addition
    to the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond
    the Jordan;  because the daughters of Manasseh
    had an inheritance among his sons. The land of
    Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
     The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem. The border
    went along to the right hand, to the inhabitants
    of En Tappuah.  The land of Tappuah belonged to
    Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh
    belonged to the children of Ephraim.  The border
    went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the
    brook. These cities belonged to Ephraim among
    the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh
    was on the north side of the brook, and ended
    at the sea.  Southward it was Ephraim's, and
    northward it was Manasseh's, and the sea was his
    border. They reached to Asher on the north, and to
    Issachar on the east.  Manasseh had three heights
    in Issachar, in Asher Beth Shean and its towns,
    and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of
    Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor
    and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and
    its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its
    towns.  Yet the children of Manasseh couldn't
    drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the
    Canaanites would dwell in that land.
     When the children of Israel had grown strong,
    they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and didn't
    utterly drive them out.  The children of Joseph
    spoke to Joshua, saying, 'Why have you given me
    just one lot and one part for an inheritance,since we
    are a numerous people, because Yahweh has blessed
    us so far?'
     Joshua said to them, 'If you are a numerous
    people, go up to the forest, and clear land for
    yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of
    the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is
    too narrow for you.'
     The children of Joseph said, 'The hill country
    is not enough for us. All the Canaanites who dwell
    in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both
      
    those who are in Beth Shean and its towns, and
    those who are in the valley of Jezreel.'
     Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, that is,
    to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, 'You are a
    numerous people, and have great power. You shall
    not have one lot only;  but the hill country shall be
    yours. Although it is a forest, you shall cut it down,
    and it's farthest extent shall be yours; for you shall
    drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots
    of iron, and though they are strong.'
    
    The whole congregation of the children of Israel
    assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up
    the Tent of Meeting there. The land was subdued
    before them.  Seven tribes remained among the
    children of Israel, which had not yet divided their
    inheritance.  Joshua said to the children of Israel,
    'How long will you neglect to go in to possess
    the land, which Yahweh, the God of your fathers,
    has given you?  Appoint for yourselves three
    men from each tribe. I will send them, and they
    shall arise, walk through the land, and describe it
    according to their inheritance; then they shall come
    to me.  They shall divide it into seven portions.
    Judah shall live in his borders on the south, and
    the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on
    the north.  You shall survey the land into seven
    parts, and bring the description here to me; and I
    will cast lots for you here before Yahweh our God.
     However, the Levites have no portion among you;
    for the priesthood of Yahweh is their inheritance.
    Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have
    received their inheritance east of the Jordan, which
    Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them.'
     The men arose and went. Joshua commanded
    those who went to survey the land,saying, 'Go walk
    through the land, survey it, and come again to me. I
    will cast lots for you here before Yahweh in Shiloh.'
    The men went and passed through the land, and
    surveyed it by cities into seven portions in a book.
    They came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.  Joshua
    cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh. There
    Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel
    according to their divisions.
     The lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
    came up according to their families. The border of
    their lot went out between the children of Judah
    and the children of Joseph.  Their border on the
    north quarter was from the Jordan. The border
    went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and
    went up through the hill country westward. It
    ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven.  The border
    passed along from there to Luz, to the side of Luz
    (also called Bethel), southward. The border went
    down to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies
    on the south of Beth Horon the lower.  The border
    extended, and turned around on the west quarter
    southward, from the mountain that lies before Beth
    Horon southward; and ended at Kiriath Baal (also
    called Kiriath Jearim), a city of the children ofJudah.
    This was the west quarter.  The south quarter
    was from the farthest part of Kiriath Jearim. The
    border went out westward, and went out to the
    spring of the waters of Nephtoah.  The border
    went down to the farthest part of the mountain
    that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom,
    which is in the valley of Rephaim northward. It
    went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of
    the Jebusite southward, and went down to En Rogel.
     It extended northward, went out at En Shemesh,
    and went out to Geliloth, which is opposite the
    ascent of Adummim. It went down to the stone
    of Bohan the son of Reuben.  It passed along
    to the side opposite the Arabah northward, and
    went down to the Arabah.  The border passed
    along to the side of Beth Hoglah northward; and
    the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea,
    at the south end of the Jordan. This was the south
    border.  The Jordan was its border on the east
    quarter. This was the inheritance of the children
    of Benjamin, by the borders around it, according
    to their families.  Now the cities of the tribe of
    the children of Benjamin according to their families
    were Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz,  Beth
    Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,
     Chephar Ammoni, Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities
    with their villages.  Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,
     Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah,  Rekem, Irpeel,
    Taralah,  Zelah, Eleph, the Jebusite (also called
    Jerusalem), Gibeath, and Kiriath; fourteen cities
    with their villages. This is the inheritance of the
    children of Benjamin according to their families.
    
     The second lot came out for Simeon, even for
    the tribe of the children of Simeon according to
    their families. Their inheritance was in the middle
    of the inheritance of the children of Judah.  They
    had fortheirinheritance Beersheba (or Sheba), Moladah,  Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem,  Eltolad, Bethul,
    Hormah,  Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah,
     Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with
    their villages; Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan; four
    cities with their villages;  and all the villages that
    were around these cities to Baalath Beer, Ramah of
    the South. This is the inheritance of the tribe of
    the children of Simeon according to their families.
     Out of the part of the children of Judah was the
    inheritance of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them.
    Therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in
    the middle of their inheritance.
     The third lot came up for the children of
    Zebulun according to their families. The border
    of their inheritance was to Sarid.  Their border
    went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached to
    Dabbesheth. It reached to the brook that is before
    Jokneam.  It turned from Sarid eastward toward
    the sunrise to the border of Chisloth Tabor. It went
    out to Daberath, and went up to Japhia.  From
    there it passed along eastward to Gath Hepher,
    to Ethkazin; and it went out at Rimmon which
    stretches to Neah. The border turned around it on
    the north to Hannathon; and it ended at the valley
    of Iphtah El;  Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah,
    and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.
     This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun
      
    according to their families, these cities with their
    villages.
     The fourth lot came out for Issachar, even for
    the children of Issachar according to their families.
     Their border was to Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem,
     Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,  Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez,  Remeth, Engannim, En Haddah, and
    Beth Pazzez.  The border reached to Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh. Their border ended at
    the Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.  This
    is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
    Issachar according to their families, the cities with
    their villages.
     The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the
    children of Asher according to their families.
     Their border was Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph,
    Allammelech, Amad, Mishal. It reached to Carmel
    westward, and to Shihorlibnath.  It turned toward
    the sunrise to Beth Dagon, and reached to Zebulun,
    and to the valley of Iphtah El northward to Beth
    Emek and Neiel. It went out to Cabul on the left
    hand,  and Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah,
    even to great Sidon. The border turned to Ramah,
    to the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned
    to Hosah. It ended at the sea by the region of Achzib;
     Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty-two
    cities with their villages. Thisisthe inheritance of
    the tribe of the children of Asher according to their
    families, these cities with their villages.
     The sixth lot came out for the children of
    Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.  Their border was from
    Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, Adami-nekeb,
    and Jabneel, to Lakkum. It ended at the Jordan.
     The border turned westward to Aznoth Tabor,
    and went out from there to Hukkok. It reached to
    Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the
    west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrise.
     The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath,
    Rakkath, Chinnereth,  Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,
    Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor,  Iron, Migdal El, Horem,
    Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh; nineteen cities with
    their villages.  This is the inheritance of the
    tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their
    families, the cities with their villages.
     The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the
    children of Dan according to their families.  The
    border of their inheritance was Zorah, Eshtaol,
    Irshemesh,  Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,  Elon,
    Timnah, Ekron,  Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,
     Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon,  Me Jarkon,
    and Rakkon, with the border opposite Joppa.  The
    border of the children of Dan went out beyond
    them; for the children of Dan went up and fought
    against Leshem, and took it, and struck it with
    the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and lived
    therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of
    Dan their forefather.  This is the inheritance of
    the tribe of the children of Dan according to their
    families, these cities with their villages.
    So they finished distributing the land for inheritance by its borders. The children of Israel gave an
    inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them.
    According to Yahweh's commandment, they gave
    him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in
    the hill country of Ephraim; and he built the city,
    and lived there. These are the inheritances, which
    Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the
    heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the
    children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot
    in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the door of the Tent of
    Meeting. So they finished dividing the land.
    
     Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,  'Speak to
    the children of Israel, saying, 'Assign the cities of
    refuge, of which I spoke to you by Moses,  that
    the man slayer who kills any person accidentally or
    unintentionally may flee there. They shall be to you
    for a refuge from the avenger of blood. He shall flee
    to one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance
    of the gate of the city, and declare his case in the
    ears of the elders of that city. They shall take him
    into the city with them, and give him a place, that
    he may live among them.  If the avenger of blood
    pursues him, then they shall not deliver up the man
    slayer into his hand; because he struck his neighbor
    unintentionally, and didn't hate him before.  He
    shall dwell in that city until he stands before the
    congregation for judgment, until the death of the
    high priest that shall be in those days. Then the man
    slayer shall return, and come to his own city, and to
    his own house, to the city he fled from.' '
     They set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill
    country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country
    of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron)
    in the hill country of Judah.  Beyond the Jordan
    at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the
    wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben,
    Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan
    in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. These were
    the appointed cities for all the children ofIsrael, and
    for the alien who lives among them, that whoever
    kills any person unintentionally might flee there,
    and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood,
    until he stands trial before the congregation.
    
     Then the heads of fathers' houses of the Levites
    came near to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the
    son of Nun, and to the heads of fathers' houses of
    the tribes of the children of Israel.  They spoke
    to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying,
    'Yahweh commanded through Moses to give us
    cities to dwell in, with their pasture lands for our
    livestock.'
     The children of Israel gave to the Levites out of
    their inheritance, according to the commandment
    of Yahweh, these cities with their pasture lands.
    The lot came out for the families of the Kohathites.
    The children of Aaron the priest, who were of the
    Levites, had thirteen cities by lot out of the tribe of
    Judah, out of the tribe of the Simeonites, and out
    of the tribe of Benjamin.  The rest of the children
    of Kohath had ten cities by lot out of the families
    of the tribe of Ephraim, out of the tribe of Dan, and
    out of the half-tribe of Manasseh.  The children of
    Gershon had thirteen cities by lot out of the families
      
    of the tribe of Issachar, out of the tribe of Asher, out
    of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe
    of Manasseh in Bashan.  The children of Merari
    according to their families had twelve cities out of
    the tribe of Reuben, out of the tribe of Gad, and out
    of the tribe of Zebulun.  The children of Israel gave
    these cities with their pasture lands by lot to the
    Levites, as Yahweh commanded by Moses.  They
    gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and
    out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these
    cities which are mentioned by name:  and they
    were for the children of Aaron, of the families of
    the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi;
    for theirs was the first lot.  They gave them
    Kiriath Arba, named after the father of Anak (also
    called Hebron), in the hill country of Judah, with
    its pasture lands around it.  But they gave the
    fields of the city and its villages to Caleb the son of
    Jephunneh for his possession.  To the children of
    Aaron the priest they gave Hebron with its pasture
    lands, the city of refuge for the man slayer, Libnah
    with its pasture lands,  Jattir with its pasture lands,
    Eshtemoa with its pasture lands,  Holon with its
    pasture lands, Debir with its pasture lands,  Ain
    with its pasture lands, Juttah with its pasture lands,
    and Beth Shemesh with its pasture lands: nine
    cities out of those two tribes.  Out of the tribe of
    Benjamin, Gibeon with its pasture lands, Geba with
    its pasture lands, Anathoth with its pasture lands,
    and Almon with its pasture lands: four cities.  All
    the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were
    thirteen cities with their pasture lands.
     The families of the children of Kohath, the
    Levites, even the rest of the children of Kohath, had
    the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
     They gave them Shechem with its pasture lands
    in the hill country of Ephraim, the city of refuge for
    the man slayer, and Gezer with its pasture lands,
     Kibzaim with its pasture lands, and Beth Horon
    with its pasture lands: four cities. Out of the tribe
    ofDan, Elteke with its pasture lands, Gibbethon with
    its pasture lands,  Aijalon with its pasture lands,
    Gath Rimmon with its pasture lands: four cities.
     Out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with
    its pasture lands, and Gath Rimmon with its pasture
    lands: two cities.  All the cities of the families
    of the rest of the children of Kohath were ten with
    their pasture lands.
     They gave to the children of Gershon, of the
    families of the Levites, out of the half-tribe of Manasseh Golan in Bashan with its pasture lands, the
    city of refuge for the man slayer, and Be Eshterah
    with its pasture lands: two cities.  Out of the tribe
    of Issachar, Kishion with its pasture lands, Daberath
    with its pasture lands,  Jarmuth with its pasture
    lands, En Gannim with its pasture lands: four cities.
     Out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its pasture
    lands, Abdon with its pasture lands, Helkath with
    its pasture lands, and Rehob with its pasture lands:
    four cities.  Out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in
    Galilee with its pasture lands, the city of refuge for
    the man slayer, Hammothdor with its pasture lands,
    and Kartan with its pasture lands: three cities.
     All the cities of the Gershonites according to
    their families were thirteen cities with their pasture
    lands.
     To the families of the children of Merari, the
    rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun,
    Jokneam with its pasture lands, Kartah with its
    pasture lands,  Dimnah with its pasture lands, and
    Nahalal with its pasture lands: four cities.  Out of
    the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its pasture lands,
    Jahaz with its pasture lands,  Kedemoth with its
    pasture lands, and Mephaath with its pasture lands:
    four cities.  Out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in
    Gilead with its pasture lands, the city of refuge
    for the man slayer, and Mahanaim with its pasture
    lands,  Heshbon with its pasture lands, Jazer with
    its pasture lands: four cities in all.  All these were
    the cities of the children of Merari according to
    their families, even the rest of the families of the
    Levites. Their lot was twelve cities.
     All the cities of the Levites among the possessions of the children of Israel were forty-eight
    cities with their pasture lands. Each of these cities
    included their pasture lands around them. It was
    this way with all these cities.
     So Yahweh gave to Israel all the land which
    he swore to give to their fathers. They possessed
    it, and lived in it.  Yahweh gave them rest all
    around, according to all that he swore to their
    fathers. Not a man of all their enemies stood before
    them. Yahweh delivered all their enemies into their
    hand.  Nothing failed of any good thing which
    Yahweh had spoken to the house of Israel. All came
    to pass.
    
     Then Joshua called the Reubenites, the Gadites,
    and the half-tribe of Manasseh,  and said to them,
    'You have kept all that Moses the servant of Yahweh
    commanded you, and have listened to my voice
    in all that I commanded you.  You have not left
    your brothers these many days to this day, but
    have performed the duty of the commandment of
    Yahweh your God.  Now Yahweh your God has
    given rest to your brothers, as he spoke to them.
    Therefore now return and go to your tents, to the
    land of your possession, which Moses the servant
    of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan.  Only take
    diligent heed to do the commandment and the law
    which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded
    you, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his
    ways, to keep his commandments, to hold fast to
    him, and to serve him with all your heart and with
    all your soul.'
     So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away;
    and they went to their tents.  Now to the one half tribe of Manasseh Moses had given inheritance in
    Bashan; but Joshua gave to the other half among
    their brothers beyond the Jordan westward. Moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he
    blessed them,  and spoke to them, saying, 'Return
    with much wealth to your tents, with very much
    livestock, with silver, with gold, with bronze, with
    iron, and with very much clothing. Divide the
    plunder of your enemies with your brothers.'
      
     The children of Reuben and the children of
    Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned, and
    departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh,
    which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of
    Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they
    owned, according to the commandment of Yahweh
    by Moses. When they came to the region near the
    Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of
    Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of
    Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, a great
    altar to look at.  The children of Israel heard this,
    'Behold, the children of Reuben and the children
    of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an
    altar along the border of the land of Canaan, in the
    region around the Jordan, on the side that belongs
    to the children of Israel.'  When the children
    of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of
    the children of Israel gathered themselves together
    at Shiloh, to go up against them to war.  The
    children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben,
    and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe
    of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the
    son of Eleazar the priest.  With him were ten
    princes, one prince of a fathers' house for each
    of the tribes of Israel; and they were each head
    of their fathers' houses among the thousands of
    Israel.  They came to the children of Reuben,
    and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe
    of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke
    with them, saying,  'The whole congregation of
    Yahweh says, 'What trespass is this that you have
    committed against the God of Israel, to turn away
    today from following Yahweh, in that you have built
    yourselves an altar, to rebel today against Yahweh?
     Is the iniquity of Peortoo little for us, from which
    we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although
    there came a plague on the congregation of Yahweh,
     that you must turn away today from following
    Yahweh? It will be, since you rebel today against
    Yahweh, that tomorrow he will be angry with the
    whole congregation of Israel.  However, if the
    land of your possession is unclean, then pass over
    to the land of the possession of Yahweh, in which
    Yahweh's tabernacle dwells, and take possession
    among us; but don't rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel
    against us, in building an altar other than Yahweh
    our God's altar.  Didn't Achan the son of Zerah
    commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath
    fell on all the congregation of Israel? That man
    didn't perish alone in his iniquity.' '
     Then the children of Reuben and the children
    of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered,
    and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel,
     'The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the Mighty One,
    God, Yahweh, he knows; and Israel shall know: if it
    was in rebellion, or if in trespass against Yahweh
    (don't save us today),  that we have built us an
    altar to turn away from following Yahweh; or if to
    offer burnt offering or meal offering, or if to offer
    sacrifices of peace offerings, let Yahweh himself
    require it.
     'If we have not out of concern done this, and
    for a reason, saying, 'In time to come your children
    might speak to our children, saying, 'What have
    you to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel?  For
    Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between
    us and you, you children of Reuben and children
    of Gad. You have no portion in Yahweh.' ' So
    your children might make our children cease from
    fearing Yahweh.
     'Therefore we said, 'Let's now prepare to build
    ourselves an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for
    sacrifice;  but it will be a witness between us and
    you, and between our generations after us, that we
    may perform the service of Yahweh before him with
    our burnt offerings, with our sacrifices, and with
    our peace offerings;' that your children may not tell
    our children in time to come, 'You have no portion
    in Yahweh.'
     'Therefore we said, 'It shall be, when they tell
    us or our generations this in time to come, that
    we shall say, 'Behold the pattern of Yahweh's altar,
    which our fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor
    for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and
    you.' '
     'Far be it from us that we should rebel against
    Yahweh, and turn away today from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt offering, for meal
    offering, or for sacrifice, besides Yahweh our God's
    altar that is before his tabernacle!'
     When Phinehas the priest, and the princes of
    the congregation, even the heads of the thousands
    of Israel that were with him, heard the words that
    the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and
    the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them
    well.  Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said
    to the children of Reuben, to the children of Gad,
    and to the children of Manasseh, 'Today we know
    that Yahweh is among us, because you have not
    committed this trespass against Yahweh. Now you
    have delivered the children ofIsrael out of Yahweh's
    hand.' Phineh as the  son of Eleazar the priest, and
    the princes, returned from the children of Reuben,
    and from the children of Gad, out of the land of
    Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of
    Israel, and brought them word again.  The thing
    pleased the children of Israel; and the children of
    Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up
    against them to war, to destroy the land in which
    the children of Reuben and the children of Gad
    lived.  The children of Reuben and the children
    of Gad named the altar 'A Witness Between Us that
    Yahweh is God.'
    
     After many days, when Yahweh had given rest
    to Israel from their enemies all around, and Joshua
    was old and well advanced in years,  Joshua called
    for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and
    for their judges and for their officers, and said to
    them, 'I am old and well advanced in years.  You
    have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to
    all these nations because of you; for it is Yahweh
    your God who has fought for you.  Behold, I have
    allotted to you these nations that remain, to be an
    inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all
    the nations that I have cut off, even to the great sea
    toward the going down of the sun.  Yahweh your
      
    God will thrust them out from before you, and drive
    them from out of your sight. You shall possess their
    land, as Yahweh your God spoke to you.
     'Therefore be very courageous to keep and to do
    all that is written in the book of the law of Moses,
    that you not turn away from it to the right hand
    or to the left;  that you not come among these
    nations, these that remain among you; neither
    make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause
    to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow
    down yourselves to them;  but hold fast to Yahweh
    your God, as you have done to this day.
     'For Yahweh has driven great and strong nations out from before you. But as for you, no man
    has stood before you to this day.  One man of you
    shall chase a thousand; for it is Yahweh your God
    who fights for you, as he spoke to you.  Take good
    heed therefore to yourselves, that you love Yahweh
    your God.
     'But if you do at all go back, and hold fast to the
    remnant of these nations, even these who remain
    among you, and make marriages with them, and go
    in to them, and they to you;  know for a certainty
    that Yahweh your God will no longer drive these
    nations from out of your sight; but they shall be a
    snare and a trap to you, a scourge in your sides, and
    thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this
    good land which Yahweh your God has given you.
     'Behold, today I am going the way of all the
    earth. You know in all your hearts and in all your
    souls that not one thing has failed of all the good
    things which Yahweh your God spoke concerning
    you. All have happened to you. Not one thing has
    failed of it.  It shall happen that as all the good
    things have come on you of which Yahweh your God
    spoke to you, so Yahweh will bring on you all the
    evil things, until he has destroyed you from off this
    good land which Yahweh your God has given you,
     when you disobey the covenant of Yahweh your
    God, which he commanded you, and go and serve
    other gods, and bow down yourselves to them. Then
    Yahweh's anger will be kindled against you, and you
    will perish quickly from off the good land which he
    has given to you.'
    
     Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to
    Shechem, and called forthe elders ofIsrael, for their
    heads, for their judges, and for their officers; and
    they presented themselves before God.  Joshua said
    to all the people, 'Yahweh, the God of Israel, says,
    'Your fathers lived of old time beyond the River,
    even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father
    of Nahor. They served other gods.  I took your
    father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him
    throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied
    his offspring,* and gave him Isaac.  I gave to Isaac
    Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau Mount Seir, to
    possess it. Jacob and his children went down into
    Egypt.
     ' 'I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt,
    according to that which I did among them: and
    afterward I brought you out.  I brought your
    fathers out of Egypt: and you came to the sea. The
    Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and
    with horsemen to the Red Sea.  When they cried
    out to Yahweh, he put darkness between you and
    the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them, and
    covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in
    Egypt. You lived in the wilderness many days.
     ' 'I brought you into the land of the Amorites,
    that lived beyond the Jordan. They fought with you,
    and I gave them into your hand. You possessed their
    land, and I destroyed them from before you.  Then
    Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and
    fought against Israel. He sent and called Balaam the
    son of Beor to curse you,  but I would not listen to
    Balaam; therefore he blessed you still. So I delivered
    you out of his hand.
     ' 'You went over the Jordan, and came to
    Jericho. The men of Jericho fought against you, the
    Amorite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hittite,
    the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I
    delivered them into your hand.  I sent the hornet
    before you, which drove them out from before you,
    even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your
    sword, nor with your bow.  I gave you a land
    on which you had not labored, and cities which
    you didn't build, and you live in them. You eat of
    vineyards and olive groves which you didn't plant.'
     'Now therefore fear Yahweh, and serve him in
    sincerity and in truth. Put away the gods which
    your fathers served beyond the River, in Egypt;
    and serve Yahweh.  If it seems evil to you to
    serve Yahweh, choose today whom you will serve;
    whether the gods which your fathers served that
    were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites,
    in whose land you dwell; but as for me and my
    house, we will serve Yahweh.'
    The people answered, 'Far be it from us that we
    should forsake Yahweh, to serve other gods;  for it
    is Yahweh our God who brought us and our fathers
    up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of
    bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight,
    and preserved us in all the way in which we went,
    and among all the peoples through the middle of
    whom we passed.  Yahweh drove out from before
    us all the peoples, even the Amorites who lived in
    the land. Therefore we also will serve Yahweh; for
    he is our God.'
     Joshua said to the people, 'You can't serve
    Yahweh, for he is a holy God. He is a jealous God.
    He will not forgive your disobedience nor your sins.
     If you forsake Yahweh, and serve foreign gods,
    then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you,
    after he has done you good.'
     The people said to Joshua, 'No, but we will
    serve Yahweh.'  Joshua said to the people, 'You
    are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Yahweh yourselves, to serve him.'
    They said, 'We are witnesses.'
     'Now therefore put away the foreign gods
    which are among you, and incline your heart to
    Yahweh, the God of Israel.'
     The people said to Joshua, 'We will serve
    Yahweh our God, and we will listen to his voice.'
    * : or, seed
      
    So Joshua made a covenant with the people that
    day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance
    in Shechem.  Joshua wrote these words in the book
    of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set
    it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary
    of Yahweh.  Joshua said to all the people, 'Behold,
    this stone shall be a witness against us, for it has
    heard all Yahweh's words which he spoke to us. It
    shall be therefore a witness against you, lest you
    deny your God.'  So Joshua sent the people away,
    each to his own inheritance.
     After these things, Joshua the son of Nun, the
    servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten
    years old.  They buried him in the border of his
    inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill
    country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain
    of Gaash.  Israel served Yahweh all the days of
    Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived
    Joshua, and had known all the work of Yahweh, that
    he had worked forIsrael. They buried the bones of
    Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out
    of Egypt, in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which
    Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father
    of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver. They
    became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.
     Eleazarthe son of Aaron died. They buried him in
    the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in
    the hill country of Ephraim.

    The Book of
    Judges, Chapters seventeen through twenty-one:

    
     There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim,
    whose name was Micah.  He said to his mother,
    'The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were
    taken from you, about which you uttered a curse,
    and also spoke it in my ears-behold, the silver is
    with me. I took it.'
    His mother said, 'May Yahweh bless my son!'
     He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver
    to his mother, then his mother said, 'I most certainly dedicate the silver to Yahweh from my hand
    for my son, to make a carved image and a molten
    image. Now therefore I will restore it to you.'
     When he restored the money to his mother, his
    mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave
    them to a silversmith, who made a carved image

      
    and a molten image out of it. It was in the house
    of Micah.
     The man Micah had a house of gods, and he
    made an ephod, and teraphim,* and consecrated
    one of his sons, who became his priest.  In those
    days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did that
    which was right in his own eyes. There was a young
    man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah,
    who was a Levite; and he lived there.  The man
    departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah,
    to live where he could find a place, and he came to
    the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah,
    as he traveled.  Micah said to him, 'Where did you
    come from?'
    He said to him, 'I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah,
    and I am looking for a place to live.'
    Micah said to him, 'Dwell with me, and be to me
    a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces
    of silver per year, a suit of clothing, and your food.'
    So the Levite went in.  The Levite was content
    to dwell with the man; and the young man was to
    him as one of his sons.  Micah consecrated the
    Levite, and the young man became his priest, and
    was in the house of Micah. Then Micah said, 'Now
    I know that Yahweh will do good to me, since I have
    a Levite as my priest.'
    
     In those days there was no king in Israel. In
    those days the tribe of the Danites sought an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day, their inheritance
    had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.
     The children of Dan sent five men of their family
    from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah
    and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to search
    it. They said to them, 'Go, explore the land!'
    They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the
    house of Micah, and lodged there. When they were
    by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the
    young man the Levite; so they went over there and
    said to him, 'Who brought you here? What do you
    do in this place? What do you have here?'
    He said to them, 'Thus and thus has Micah dealt
    with me, and he has hired me, and I have become his
    priest.'
     They said to him, 'Please ask counsel of God,
    that we may know whether our way which we go
    shall be prosperous.'
     The priest said to them, 'Go in peace. Your way
    in which you go is before Yahweh.'
     Then the five men departed and came to Laish
    and saw the people who were there, how they lived
    in safety, in the way of the Sidonians, quiet and
    secure; for there was no one in the land possessing
    authority, that might put them to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and
    had no dealings with anyone else.  They came
    to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol; and their
    brothers asked them, 'What do you say?'
     They said, 'Arise, and let's go up against them;
    for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very
    good. Do you stand still? Don't be slothful to go
    and to enter in to possess the land.  When you go,
    you will come to an unsuspecting people, and the
    land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a
    place where there is no lack of anything that is in
    the earth.'
     The family of the Danites set out from Zorah
    and Eshtaol with six hundred men armed with
    weapons of war.  They went up and encamped
    in Kiriath Jearim in Judah. Therefore they call that
    place Mahaneh Dan to this day. Behold, it is behind
    Kiriath Jearim.  They passed from there to the
    hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of
    Micah.
     Then the five men who went to spy out the
    country of Laish answered and said to their brothers, 'Do you know that there is in these houses an
    ephod, and teraphim,* and a carved image, and a
    molten image? Now therefore consider what you
    have to do.'  They went over there and came
    to the house of the young Levite man, even to the
    house of Micah, and asked him how he was doing.
     The six hundred men armed with their weapons
    of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by
    the entrance of the gate.  The five men who went
    to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and
    took the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim,
    and the molten image; and the priest stood by the
    entrance of the gate with the six hundred men
    armed with weapons of war.
     When these went into Micah's house, and took
    the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and
    the molten image, the priest said to them, 'What
    are you doing?'
     They said to him, 'Hold your peace, put your
    hand on your mouth, and go with us. Be a father
    and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be priest to
    the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and
    a family in Israel?'
     The priest's heart was glad, and he took the
    ephod, the teraphim, and the engraved image, and
    went with the people.  So they turned and departed, and put the little ones, the livestock, and the
    goods before them.  When they were a good way
    from the house of Micah, the men who were in the
    houses near Micah's house gathered together and
    overtook the children of Dan.  as the y called to the
    children of Dan, they turned their faces, and said to
    Micah, 'What ails you, that you come with such a
    company?'
     He said, 'You have taken away my gods which
    I made, and the priest, and have gone away! What
    more do I have? How can you ask me, 'What ails
    you?' '
     The children of Dan said to him, 'Don't let your
    voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall on
    you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your
    household.'
     The children of Dan went their way; and when
    Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he
    turned and went back to his house.  They took
    that which Micah had made, and the priest whom
    he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and

      
    unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the
    sword; then they burned the city with fire.  There
    was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and
    they had no dealings with anyone else; and it was
    in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built
    the city and lived in it.  They called the name of
    the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father,
    who was born to Israel; however the name of the
    city used to be Laish.  The children of Dan set up
    for themselves the engraved image; and Jonathan,
    the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons
    were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day
    of the captivity of the land.  So they set up for
    themselves Micah's engraved image which he made,
    and it remained all the time that God's house was in
    Shiloh.
    
     In those days, when there was no king in Israel,
    there was a certain Levite living on the farther
    side of the hill country of Ephraim, who took for
    himself a concubine out of Bethlehem Judah.  His
    concubine played the prostitute against him, and
    went away from him to her father's house to Bethlehem Judah, and was there for four months.  Her
    husband arose and went after her to speak kindly to
    her, to bring her again, having his servant with him
    and a couple of donkeys. She brought him into her
    father's house; and when the father of the young
    lady saw him, he rejoiced to meet him. His father-in-law, the young lady's father, kept him there; and
    he stayed with him three days. So they ate and
    drank, and stayed there.
     On the fourth day, they got up early in the
    morning, and he rose up to depart. The young
    lady's father said to his son-in-law, 'Strengthen
    your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward
    you shall go your way.'  So they sat down, ate,
    and drank, both of them together. Then the young
    lady's father said to the man, 'Please be pleased to
    stay all night, and let your heart be merry.'  The
    man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged
    him, and he stayed there again.  He arose early
    in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the
    young lady's father said, 'Please strengthen your
    heart and stay until the day declines;' and they both
    ate.
     When the man rose up to depart, he, and his
    concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the
    young lady's father, said to him, 'Behold, now the
    day draws toward evening, please stay all night.
    Behold,the day is ending. Stay here,that your heart
    may be merry; and tomorrow go on your way early,
    that you may go home.'  But the man wouldn't
    stay that night, but he rose up and went near Jebus
    (also called Jerusalem). With him were a couple of
    saddled donkeys. His concubine also was with him.
    When they were by Jebus,the day was farspent;
    and the servant said to his master, 'Please come and
    let's enter into this city of the Jebusites, and stay in
    it.'
     His master said to him, 'We won't enter into
    the city of a foreigner that is not of the children of
    Israel; but we will pass over to Gibeah.'  He said
    to his servant, 'Come and let's draw near to one
    of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in
    Ramah.'  So they passed on and went their way;
    and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which
    belongs to Benjamin.  They went over there, to go
    in to stay in Gibeah. He went in, and sat down in
    the street of the city; for there was no one who took
    them into his house to stay.
     Behold, an old man came from his work out of
    the field at evening. Now the man was from the hill
    country of Ephraim, and he lived in Gibeah; but the
    men of the place were Benjamites.  He lifted up
    his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street
    of the city; and the old man said, 'Where are you
    going? Where did you come from?'
     He said to him, 'We are passing from Bethlehem Judah to the farther side of the hill country of
    Ephraim. I am from there, and I went to Bethlehem
    Judah. I am going to Yahweh's house; and there is
    no one who has taken me into his house. Yet there
    is both straw and feed for our donkeys; and there is
    bread and wine also for me, and for your servant,
    and for the young man who is with your servants.
    There is no lack of anything.'
     The old man said, 'Peace be to you! Just let me
    supply all your needs, but don't sleep in the street.'
     So he brought him into his house, and gave the
    donkeys fodder. Then they washed their feet, and
    ate and drank.  As they were making their hearts
    merry, behold, the men of the city, certain wicked
    fellows, surrounded the house, beating at the door;
    and they spoke to the master of the house, the old
    man, saying, 'Bring out the man who came into
    your house, that we can have sex with him!'
     The man, the master of the house, went out to
    them, and said to them, 'No, my brothers, please
    don't act so wickedly; since this man has come into
    my house, don't do this folly.  Behold, here is
    my virgin daughter and his concubine. I will bring
    them out now. Humble them, and do with them
    what seems good to you; but to this man don't do
    any such folly.'
     But the men wouldn't listen to him; so the
    man grabbed his concubine, and brought her out to
    them; and they had sex with her, and abused her
    all night until the morning. When the day began to
    dawn, they let her go.  Then the woman came in
    the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door
    of the man's house where her lord was, until it was
    light. Herlord rose up in the morning and opened
    the doors of the house, and went out to go his way;
    and behold, the woman his concubine had fallen
    down at the door of the house, with her hands on
    the threshold.
     He said to her, 'Get up, and let's get going!'
    but no one answered. Then he took her up on the
    donkey; and the man rose up, and went to his place.
     When he had come into his house, he took a
    knife and cut up his concubine, and divided her,
    limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her
    throughout all the borders of Israel.  It was so,that
    all who saw it said, 'Such a deed has not been done
    or seen from the day that the children of Israel came
      
    up out of the land of Egypt to this day! Consider it,
    take counsel, and speak.'
    
     Then all the children of Israel went out, and
    the congregation was assembled as one man, from
    Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to
    Yahweh at Mizpah.  The chiefs of all the people,
    even of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves
    in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred
    thousand footmen who drew sword.  (Now the
    children of Benjamin heard that the children of
    Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) The children of Israel
    said, 'Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?'
     The Levite, the husband of the woman who
    was murdered, answered, 'I came into Gibeah that
    belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend
    the night.  The men of Gibeah rose against me,
    and surrounded the house by night. They intended
    to kill me and they raped my concubine, and she
    is dead.  I took my concubine and cut her in
    pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of
    the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed
    lewdness and folly in Israel.  Behold, you children
    of Israel, all of you, give here your advice and
    counsel.'
     All the people arose as one man, saying, 'None
    of us will go to his tent, neither will any of us turn to
    his house.  But now this is the thing which we will
    do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot;  and
    we will take ten men of one hundred throughout
    all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one
    thousand, and a thousand out often thousand to get
    food for the people, that they may do, when they
    come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the
    folly that the men of Gibeah have done in Israel.'
     So all the men of Israel were gathered against the
    city, knit together as one man.
     The tribes of Israel sent men through all the
    tribe of Benjamin, saying, 'What wickedness is this
    that has happened among you?  Now therefore
    deliver up the men, the wicked fellows who are in
    Gibeah, that we may put them to death and put
    away evil from Israel.'
    But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of
    their brothers,the children ofIsrael. The children
    of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of
    the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the
    children of Israel.  The children of Benjamin were
    counted on that day out of the cities twenty-six
    thousand men who drew the sword, in addition to
    the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were counted seven
    hundred chosen men.  Among all these soldiers
    there were seven hundred chosen men who were
    left-handed. Every one of them could sling a stone
    at a hair and not miss.  The men of Israel, besides
    Benjamin, were counted four hundred thousand
    men who drew sword. All these were men of war.
     The children of Israel arose, went up to Bethel,
    and asked counsel of God. They asked, 'Who shall
    go up for us first to battle against the children of
    Benjamin?'
    Yahweh said, 'Judah first.'
     The children of Israel rose up in the morning
    and encamped against Gibeah.  The men of Israel
    went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of
    Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.
    The children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and
    on that day destroyed twenty-two thousand of the
    Israelite men down to the ground.  The people,
    the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set
    the battle again in array in the place where they set
    themselves in array the first day.  The children
    of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until
    evening; and they asked of Yahweh, saying, 'Shall
    I again draw near to battle against the children of
    Benjamin my brother?'
    Yahweh said, 'Go up against him.'
     The children of Israel came near against the
    children of Benjamin the second day.  Benjamin
    went out against them out of Gibeah the second day,
    and destroyed down to the ground of the children of
    Israel again eighteen thousand men. All these drew
    the sword.
     Then all the children of Israel and all the
    people went up, and came to Bethel, and wept,
    and sat there before Yahweh, and fasted that day
    until evening; then they offered burnt offerings and
    peace offerings before Yahweh.  The children of
    Israel asked Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant of
    God was there in those days,  and Phinehas, the
    son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it
    in those days), saying, 'Shall I yet again go out to
    battle against the children of Benjamin my brother,
    or shall I cease?'
    Yahweh said, 'Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver
    him into your hand.'
     Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah.  The
    children of Israel went up against the children of
    Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in
    array against Gibeah, as at other times.  The
    children of Benjamin went out against the people,
    and were drawn away from the city; and they began
    to strike and kill of the people as at other times, in
    the highways, of which one goes up to Bethel and
    the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men
    of Israel.
    The children of Benjamin said, 'They are struck
    down before us, as at the first.' But the children of
    Israel said, 'Let's flee, and draw them away from the
    city to the highways.'
     All the men of Israel rose up out of their place
    and set themselves in array at Baal Tamar. Then the
    ambushers of Israel broke out of their place, even
    out of Maareh Geba.  Ten thousand chosen men
    out of all Israel came over against Gibeah, and the
    battle was severe; but they didn't know that disaster
    was close to them.  Yahweh struck Benjamin
    before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed
    of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand one
    hundred men. All these drew the sword.  So the
    children of Benjamin saw that they were struck, for
    the men of Israel yielded to Benjamin because they
    trusted the ambushers whom they had set against
    Gibeah.  The ambushers hurried, and rushed on
    Gibeah; then the ambushers spread out, and struck
    all the city with the edge of the sword.  Now the
      
    appointed sign between the men of Israel and the
    ambushers was that they should make a great cloud
    of smoke rise up out of the city.  The men of Israel
    turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike
    and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons;
    for they said, 'Surely they are struck down before
    us, as in the first battle.'  But when the cloud
    began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke,
    the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold,
    the whole city went up in smoke to the sky.  The
    men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were
    dismayed; for they saw that disaster had come on
    them.  Therefore they turned their backs before
    the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness,
    but the battle followed hard after them; and those
    who came out of the cities destroyed them in the
    middle of it.  They surrounded the Benjamites,
    chased them, and trod them down at their resting
    place, as far as near Gibeah toward the sunrise.
     Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these
    were men of valor.  They turned and fled toward
    the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. They gleaned
    five thousand men of them in the highways, and
    followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck two
    thousand men of them.  So that all who fell that
    day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men
    who drew the sword. All these were men of valor.
     But six hundred men turned and fled toward the
    wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed in
    the rock of Rimmon four months.  The men of
    Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and
    struck them with the edge of the sword-including
    the entire city, the livestock, and all that they found.
    Moreover they set all the cities which they found on
    fire.
    
    Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah,saying, 'None of us will give his daughter to Benjamin
    as a wife.' The people came to Bethel and sat there
    until evening before God, and lifted up their voices,
    and wept severely.  They said, 'Yahweh, the God of
    Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that there
    should be one tribe lacking in Israel today?'
     On the next day, the people rose early and
    built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and
    peace offerings.  The children of Israel said, 'Who
    is there among all the tribes of Israel who didn't
    come up in the assembly to Yahweh?' For they
    had made a great oath concerning him who didn't
    come up to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, 'He shall
    surely be put to death.'  The children of Israel
    grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, 'There
    is one tribe cut off from Israel today.  How shall
    we provide wives for those who remain, since we
    have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them
    of our daughters to wives?'  They said, 'What
    one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn't come
    up to Yahweh to Mizpah?' Behold, no one came
    from Jabesh Gilead to the camp to the assembly.
     For when the people were counted, behold, there
    were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there.
     The congregation sent twelve thousand of the
    most valiant men there, and commanded them,
    saying, 'Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh
    Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women
    and the little ones.  This is the thing that you
    shall do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and
    every woman who has lain with a man.'  They
    found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four
    hundred young virgins who had not known man by
    lying with him; and they brought them to the camp
    to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
     The whole congregation sent and spoke to the
    children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.  Benjamin
    returned at that time; and they gave them the
    women whom they had saved alive of the women
    of Jabesh Gilead. There still weren't enough for
    them.  The people grieved for Benjamin, because
    Yahweh had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.
     Then the elders of the congregation said, 'How
    shall we provide wives for those who remain, since
    the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?' They
    said, 'There must be an inheritance for those who
    are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted
    out from Israel.  However, we may not give them
    wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel
    had sworn, saying, 'Cursed is he who gives a wife
    to Benjamin.' '  They said, 'Behold, there is a
    feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh, which
    is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the
    highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and
    on the south of Lebonah.'  They commanded
    the children of Benjamin, saying, 'Go and lie in
    wait in the vineyards,  and see, and behold, if
    the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the
    dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each
    man catch his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and
    go to the land of Benjamin.  It shall be, when their
    fathers or their brothers come to complain to us,
    that we will say to them, 'Grant them graciously to
    us, because we didn't take for each man his wife in
    battle, neither did you give them to them; otherwise
    you would now be guilty.' '
    The children of Benjamin did so, and took wives
    for themselves according to their number, of those
    who danced, whom they carried off. They went and
    returned to their inheritance, built the cities, and
    lived in them.  The children of Israel departed
    from there at that time, every man to his tribe and
    to his family, and they each went out from there to
    his own inheritance.  In those days there was no
    king in Israel. Everyone did that which was right in
    his own eyes.
