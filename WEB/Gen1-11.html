    The First Book of Moses,
    Commonly Called
    Genesis;
    
     In the beginning, God* created the heavens and
    the earth.  The earth was formless and empty.
    Darkness was on the surface of the deep and God’s
    Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
     God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was
    light.  God saw the light, and saw that it was good.
    God divided the light from the darkness.  God
    called the light 'day', and the darkness he called
    'night'. There was evening and there was morning,
    the first day.
    God said, 'Let there be an expanse in the middle
    of the waters, and let it divide the waters from
    the waters.'  God made the expanse, and divided
    the waters which were under the expanse from the
    waters which were above the expanse; and it was  so.
     God called the expanse 'sky'. There was evening
    and there was morning, a second day.
     God said, 'Let the waters under the sky be
    gathered together to one place, and let the dry land
    appear;' and it was so.  God called the dry land
    'earth', and the gathering together of the waters he
    called 'seas'. God saw that it was good.  God said,
    'Let the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and
    fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with their
    seeds in it, on the earth;' and it was so.  The earth
    yielded grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind,
    and trees bearing fruit, with their seeds in it, after
    their kind; and God saw that it was good.  There
    was evening and there was morning, a third day.
     God said, 'Let there be lights in the expanse
    of the sky to divide the day from the night; and
    let them be for signs to mark seasons, days, and
    years;  and let them be for lights in the expanse
    of the sky to give light on the earth;' and it was
    so.  God made the two great lights: the greater
    light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the
    night. He also made the stars. God set them in the
    expanse of the sky to give light to the earth,  and to
    rule over the day and over the night, and to divide
    the light from the darkness. God saw that it was
    good.  There was evening and there was morning,
    a fourth day.
     God said, 'Let the waters abound with living
    creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the
    open expanse of the sky.'  God created the large
    sea creatures and every living creature that moves,
    with which the waters swarmed, after their kind,
    and every winged bird after its kind. God saw that it
    was good.  God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful,
    and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let
    birds multiply on the earth.'  There was evening
    and there was morning, a fifth day.
     God said, 'Let the earth produce living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things,
    and animals of the earth after their kind;' and it
    was so.  God made the animals of the earth after
    their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and
    everything that creeps on the ground after its kind.
    God saw that it was good.
     God said, 'Let’s make man in our image, after
    our likeness. Let them have dominion over the
    fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and
    over the livestock, and over all the earth, and over
    every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.'
     God created man in his own image. In God’s
    image he created him; male and female he created
    them.  God blessed them. God said to them, 'Be
    fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have
    dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of
    the sky, and over every living thing that moves on
    the earth.'  God said, 'Behold, I have given you
    every herb yielding seed, which is on the surface
    of all the earth, and every tree, which bears fruit
    yielding seed. It will be your food.  To every
    animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky,
    and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which
    there is life, I have given every green herb for food;'
    and it was so.
     God saw everything that he had made, and,
    behold, it was very good. There was evening and
    there was morning, a sixth day.
    
     The heavens, the earth, and all their vast array
    were finished.  On the seventh day God finished
    his work which he had done; and he rested on the
    seventh day from all his work which he had done.
     God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy,
    because he rested in it from all his work of creation
    which he had done.
     This is the history of the generations of the
    heavens and of the earth when they were created,
    in the day that Yahweh* God made the earth and
    the heavens.  No plant of the field was yet in the
    earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up;
    for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the
    earth. There was not a man to till the ground, but a
    mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole
    surface of the ground.  Yahweh God formed man
    from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his
    nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
    soul.  Yahweh God planted a garden eastward,
    in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had
    formed.  Out of the ground Yahweh God made
    every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight, and
    good for food, including the tree of life in the middle
    of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good
    and evil.  A river went out of Eden to water the
    garden; and from there it was parted, and became
    the source of four rivers.  The name of the first is
    Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah,
    where there is gold;  and the gold of that land
    is good. Bdellium and onyx stone are also there.
     The name of the second river is Gihon. It is the
    same river that flows through the whole land of

      
    Cush.  The name of the third river is Hiddekel.
    This is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The
    fourth river is the Euphrates.  Yahweh God took
    the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to
    cultivate and keep it.  Yahweh God commanded
    the man, saying, 'You may freely eat of every tree
    of the garden;  but you shall not eat of the tree of
    the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that
    you eat of it, you will surely die.'
     Yahweh God said, 'It is not good for the man
    to be alone. I will make him a helper comparable
    to him.'  Out of the ground Yahweh God formed
    every animal of the field, and every bird of the sky,
    and brought them to the man to see what he would
    call them. Whatever the man called every living
    creature became its name.  The man gave names
    to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to
    every animal of the field; but for man there was not
    found a helper comparable to him.  Yahweh God
    caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. As the
    man slept, he took one of his ribs, and closed up
    the flesh in its place.  Yahweh God made a woman
    from the rib which he had taken from the man, and
    brought her to the man.  The man said, 'This is
    now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She
    will be called ‘woman,’ because she was taken out
    of Man.'  Therefore a man will leave his father
    and his mother, and will join with his wife, and they
    will be one flesh.  The man and his wife were both
    naked, and they were not ashamed.
    
     Now the serpent was more subtle than any
    animal of the field which Yahweh God had made. He
    said to the woman, 'Has God really said, ‘You shall
    not eat of any tree of the garden’?'
     The woman said to the serpent, 'We may eat
    fruit from the trees of the garden,  but not the fruit
    of the tree which isin the middle of the garden. God
    has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch
    it, lest you die.’ '
     The serpent said to the woman, 'You won’t
    really die,  for God knows that in the day you eat it,
    your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God,
    knowing good and evil.'
    When the woman saw that the tree was good for
    food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that
    the tree was to be desired to make one wise,she took
    some of its fruit, and ate. Then she gave some to her
    husband with her, and he ate it, too.  Their eyes
    were opened, and they both knew that they were
    naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made
    coverings for themselves.  They heard Yahweh
    God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the
    day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from
    the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the
    garden.
     Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him,
    'Where are you?'
    The man said, 'I heard your voice in the garden,
    and I was afraid, because I was naked; so I hid
    myself.'
     God said, 'Who told you that you were naked?
    Have you eaten from the tree thatI commanded you
    not to eat from?'
     The man said, 'The woman whom you gave to
    be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I
    ate it.'
     Yahweh God said to the woman, 'What have
    you done?'
    The woman said, 'The serpent deceived me, and
    I ate.'
     Yahweh God said to the serpent,
    'Because you have done this,
    you are cursed above all livestock,
    and above every animal of the field.
    You shall go on your belly
    and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.
     I will put hostility between you and the woman,
    and between your offspring and her offspring.
    He will bruise your head,
    and you will bruise his heel.'
     To the woman he said,
    'I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.
    You will bear children in pain.
    Your desire will be for your husband,
    and he will rule over you.'
     To Adam he said,
    'Because you have listened to your wife’s voice,
    and have eaten from the tree,
    about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You
    shall not eat of it,’
    the ground is cursed for your sake.
    You will eat from it with much labor all the days of
    your life.
     It will yield thorns and thistles to you;
    and you will eat the herb of the field.
     You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until
    you return to the ground,
    for you were taken out of it.
    For you are dust,
    and you shall return to dust.'
     The man called his wife Eve because she would
    be the mother of all the living. Yahweh God made
    garments of animal skins for Adam and for his wife,
    and clothed them.
    Yahweh God said, 'Behold,the man has become
    like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he
    reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life,
    and eat, and live forever —'  Therefore Yahweh
    God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the
    ground from which he was taken.  So he drove out
    the man; and he placed cherubim* at the east of the
    garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned
    every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.
    
     The man knew* Eve his wife. She conceived,
    and gave birth to Cain, and said, 'I have gotten a
    man with Yahweh’s help.'  Again she gave birth,

      
    to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep,
    but Cain was a tiller of the ground.  As time
    passed, Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from
    the fruit of the ground.  Abel also brought some
    of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh
    respected Abel and his offering,  but he didn’t
    respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry,
    and the expression on his face fell.  Yahweh said to
    Cain, 'Why are you angry? Why has the expression
    of your face fallen?  If you do well, won’t it be lifted
    up? If you don’t do well,sin crouches at the door. Its
    desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.'  Cain
    said to Abel, his brother, 'Let’s go into the field.'
    While they were in the field, Cain rose up against
    Abel, his brother, and killed him.
     Yahweh said to Cain, 'Where is Abel, your
    brother?'
    He said, 'I don’t know. Am I my brother’s
    keeper?'
     Yahweh said, 'What have you done? The voice
    of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground.
    Now you are cursed because of the ground, which
    has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s
    blood from your hand.  From now on, when you
    till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you.
    You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.'
     Cain said to Yahweh, 'My punishment is
    greater than I can bear.  Behold, you have driven
    me out today from the surface of the ground. I will
    be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and
    a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill
    me.'
     Yahweh said to him, 'Therefore whoever slays
    Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.'
    Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone
    finding him would not strike him.
     Cain left Yahweh’s presence, and lived in the
    land of Nod, east of Eden.  Cain knew his wife.
    She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built
    a city, and named the city after the name of his
    son, Enoch.  Irad was born to Enoch. Irad became
    the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father
    of Methushael. Methushael became the father of
    Lamech.  Lamech took two wives: the name of
    the first one was Adah, and the name of the second
    one was Zillah.  Adah gave birth to Jabal, who
    was the father of those who dwell in tents and have
    livestock.  His brother’s name was Jubal, who was
    the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.
     Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of
    every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. Tubal
    Cain’s sister was Naamah.  Lamech said to his
    wives,
    'Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.
    You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech,
    for I have slain a man for wounding me,
    a young man for bruising me.
     If Cain will be avenged seven times,
    truly Lamech seventy-seven times.'
     Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to
    a son, and named him Seth, saying, 'for God has
    given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain
    killed him.'  A son was also born to Seth, and he
    named him Enosh. At that time men began to call
    on Yahweh’s name.
    
     This is the book of the generations of Adam.
    In the day that God created man, he made him in
    God’s likeness.  He created them male and female,
    and blessed them. On the day they were created,
    he named them Adam.*  Adam lived one hundred
    thirty years, and became the father of a son in his
    own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.
     The days of Adam after he became the father of
    Seth were eight hundred years, and he became the
    father of other sons and daughters.  All the days
    that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years,
    then he died.
     Seth lived one hundred five years, then became
    the father of Enosh.  Seth lived after he became
    the father of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and
    became the father of othersons and daughters. All
    of the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years,
    then he died.
     Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father
    of Kenan.  Enosh lived after he became the father
    of Kenan eight hundred fifteen years, and became
    the father of other sons and daughters.  All of the
    days of Enosh were nine hundred five years, then he
    died.
     Kenan lived seventy years, then became the
    father of Mahalalel.  Kenan lived after he became
    the father of Mahalalel eight hundred forty years,
    and became the father of other sons and daughters
     and all of the days of Kenan were nine hundred
    ten years, then he died.
     Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, then became
    the father of Jared.  Mahalalel lived after he
    became the father of Jared eight hundred thirty
    years, and became the father of other sons and
    daughters. All of the days of Mahalalel were eight
    hundred ninety-five years, then he died.
     Jared lived one hundred sixty-two years, then
    became the father of Enoch.  Jared lived after he
    became the father of Enoch eight hundred years,
    and became the father of other sons and daughters.
     All of the days of Jared were nine hundred sixtytwo years, then he died.
     Enoch lived sixty-five years, then became the
    father of Methuselah.  After Methuselah’s birth,
    Enoch walked with God for three hundred years,
    and became the father of more sons and daughters.
     All the days of Enoch were three hundred sixtyfive years.  Enoch walked with God, and he was
    not found, for God took him.
     Methuselah lived one hundred eightyseven years, then became the father of Lamech.
     Methuselah lived after he became the father
    of Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years, and
    became the father of other sons and daughters.
     All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred
    sixty-nine years, then he died.

      
     Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years,
    then became the father of a son.  He named him
    Noah, saying, 'This one will comfort us in our work
    and in the toil of our hands, caused by the ground
    which Yahweh has cursed.'  Lamech lived after
    he became the father of Noah five hundred ninetyfive years, and became the father of other sons and
    daughters.  All the days of Lamech were seven
    hundred seventy-seven years, then he died.
     Noah was five hundred years old, then Noah
    became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
    
     When men began to multiply on the surface
    of the ground, and daughters were born to them,
     God’s sons saw that men’s daughters were beautiful, and they took any that they wanted for themselves as wives.  Yahweh said, 'My Spirit will not
    strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; so
    his days will be one hundred twenty years.'  The
    Nephilim* were in the earth in those days, and
    also after that, when God’s sons came in to men’s
    daughters and had children with them. Those were
    the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.
     Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was
    great in the earth, and that every imagination of
    the thoughts of man’s heart was continually only
    evil.  Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on
    the earth, and it grieved him in his heart.  Yahweh
    said, 'I will destroy man whom I have created from
    the surface of the ground—man, along with animals,
    creeping things, and birds of the sky—forI am sorry
    that I have made them.'  But Noah found favor in
    Yahweh’s eyes.
     This is the history of the generations of Noah:
    Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the
    people of his time. Noah walked with God.  Noah
    became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and
    Japheth.  The earth was corrupt before God, and
    the earth was filled with violence.  God saw the
    earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had
    corrupted their way on the earth.
     God said to Noah, 'I will bring an end to all
    flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through
    them. Behold, I will destroy them and the earth.
     Make a ship of gopher wood. You shall make
    rooms in the ship, and shall seal it inside and outside
    with pitch.  This is how you shall make it. The
    length of the ship shall be three hundred cubits, its
    width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits. You
    shall make a roof in the ship, and you shall finish it
    to a cubit upward. You shall set the door of the ship
    in its side. You shall make it with lower,second, and
    third levels.  I, even I, will bring the flood of waters
    on this earth, to destroy all flesh having the breath
    of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the
    earth will die.  But I will establish my covenant
    with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your
    sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. Of
    every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two
    of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with
    you. They shall be male and female.  Of the birds
    after their kind, of the livestock after their kind, of
    every creeping thing of the ground after its kind,
    two of every sort will come to you, to keep them
    alive.  Take with you some of all food that is eaten,
    and gather it to yourself; and it will be for food for
    you, and for them.' Thus Noah did. He did all that
    God commanded him.
    
     Yahweh said to Noah, 'Come with all of your
    household into the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me in this generation.  You shall
    take seven pairs of every clean animal with you, the
    male and his female. Of the animals that are not
    clean, take two, the male and his female.  Also
    of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, male and
    female, to keep seed alive on the surface of all the
    earth.  In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the
    earth for forty days and forty nights. I will destroy
    every living thing that I have made from the surface
    of the ground.'
     Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded
    him.
     Noah was six hundred years old when the flood
    of waters came on the earth.  Noah went into
    the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons’
    wives, because of the floodwaters.  Clean animals,
    unclean animals, birds, and everything that creeps
    on the ground  went by pairs to Noah into the
    ship, male and female, as God commanded Noah.
    After the seven days, the floodwaters came on the
    earth.  In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in
    the second month, on the seventeenth day of the
    month, on that day all the fountains of the great
    deep burst open, and the sky’s windows opened.
     It rained on the earth forty days and forty nights.
     In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and
    Japheth—the sons ofNoah—andNoah’s wife and the
    three wives of his sons with them, entered into the
    ship—  they, and every animal after its kind, all
    the livestock after their kind, every creeping thing
    that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every
    bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.  Pairs
    from all flesh with the breath of life in them went
    into the ship to Noah.  Those who went in, went
    in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded
    him; then Yahweh shut him in.  The flood was
    forty days on the earth. The waters increased, and
    lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the
    earth.  The waters rose, and increased greatly on
    the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the
    waters.  The waters rose very high on the earth.
    All the high mountains that were under the whole
    sky were covered.  The waters rose fifteen cubits*
    higher, and the mountains were covered.  All
    flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds,
    livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps
    on the earth, and every man.  All on the dry land,
    in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life,
    died. Every living thing was destroyed that was on

      
    the surface of the ground, including man, livestock,
    creeping things, and birds of the sky. They were
    destroyed from the earth. Only Noah was left, and
    those who were with him in the ship.  The waters
    flooded the earth one hundred fifty days.
    
     God remembered Noah, all the animals, and
    all the livestock that were with him in the ship;
    and God made a wind to pass over the earth. The
    waters subsided.  The deep’s fountains and the
    sky’s windows were also stopped, and the rain from
    the sky was restrained.  The waters continually
    receded from the earth. After the end of one
    hundred fifty days the waters receded.  The ship
    rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth
    day of the month, on Ararat’s mountains.  The
    waters receded continually until the tenth month.
    In the tenth month, on the first day of the month,
    the tops of the mountains were visible.
     At the end of forty days, Noah opened the
    window of the ship which he had made,  and he
    sent out a raven. It went back and forth, until the
    waters were dried up from the earth.  He himself
    sent out a dove to see if the waters were abated from
    the surface of the ground,  but the dove found no
    place to rest her foot, and she returned into the
    ship to him, for the waters were on the surface of
    the whole earth. He put out his hand, and took
    her, and brought her to him into the ship.  He
    waited yet another seven days; and again he sent
    the dove out of the ship.  The dove came back
    to him at evening and, behold, in her mouth was a
    freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the
    waters were abated from the earth. He waited yet
    another seven days, and sent out the dove; and she
    didn’t return to him any more.
     In the six hundred first year, in the first month,
    the first day of the month, the waters were dried
    up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of
    the ship, and looked. He saw that the surface of
    the ground was dry.  In the second month, on
    the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was
    dry.
     God spoke to Noah, saying,  'Go out of the
    ship, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons’
    wives with you.  Bring out with you every living
    thing that is with you of all flesh, including birds,
    livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on
    the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the
    earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth.'
     Noah went out, with his sons, his wife, and
    his sons’ wives with him.  Every animal, every
    creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves on
    the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.
     Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of
    every clean animal, and of every clean bird, and
    offered burnt offerings on the altar.  Yahweh
    smelled the pleasant aroma. Yahweh said in his
    heart, 'I will not again curse the ground any more
    for man’s sake because the imagination of man’s
    heart is evil from his youth. I will never again strike
    every living thing, asI have done. While the earth
    remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat,
    and summer and winter, and day and night will not
    cease.'
    
    God blessedNoah and his sons, and said to them,
    'Be fruitful, multiply, and replenish the earth. The
    fear of you and the dread of you will be on every
    animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky.
    Everything that moves along the ground, and all the
    fish of the sea, are delivered into your hand.  Every
    moving thing that lives will be food for you. As I
    gave you the green herb, I have given everything to
    you.  But flesh with its life, that is, its blood, you
    shall not eat.  I will surely require accounting for
    your life’s blood. At the hand of every animal I will
    require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of
    every man’s brother, I will require the life of man.
     Whoever sheds man’s blood, his blood will be shed
    by man, for God made man in his own image.  Be
    fruitful and multiply. Increase abundantly in the
    earth, and multiply in it.'
     God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him,
    saying,  'As for me, behold, I establish my covenant
    with you, and with your offspring after you,  and
    with every living creature that is with you: the
    birds, the livestock, and every animal of the earth
    with you, of all that go out of the ship, even every
    animal of the earth.  I will establish my covenant
    with you: All flesh will not be cut off any more by
    the waters of the flood. There will never again be
    a flood to destroy the earth.'  God said, 'This is
    the token of the covenant which I make between me
    and you and every living creature that is with you,
    for perpetual generations:  I set my rainbow in the
    cloud, and it will be a sign of a covenant between
    me and the earth.  When I bring a cloud over the
    earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,  I
    will remember my covenant, which is between me
    and you and every living creature of all flesh, and
    the waters will no more become a flood to destroy
    all flesh.  The rainbow will be in the cloud. I
    will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting
    covenant between God and every living creature of
    all flesh that is on the earth.'  God said to Noah,
    'This is the token of the covenant which I have
    established between me and all flesh that is on the
    earth.'
     The sons of Noah who went out from the ship
    were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham is the father of
    Canaan.  These three were the sons of Noah, and
    from these the whole earth was populated.
     Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a
    vineyard. He drank of the wine and got drunk. He
    was uncovered within his tent.  Ham, the father
    of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told
    his two brothers outside.  Shem and Japheth took
    a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went
    in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their
    father. Their faces were backwards, and they didn’t
    see their father’s nakedness. Noah awoke from his
    wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to
    him.  He said,
    'Canaan is cursed.
      
    He will be a servant of servants to his brothers.'
     He said,
    'Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem.
    Let Canaan be his servant.
     May God enlarge Japheth.
    Let him dwell in the tents of Shem.
    Let Canaan be his servant.'
     Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the
    flood.  All the days of Noah were nine hundred
    fifty years, and then he died.
    
    Now this is the history of the generations of the
    sons of Noah and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons
    were born to them after the flood.
     The sons of Japheth were: Gomer, Magog,
    Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.  The sons
    of Gomer were: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
     The sons of Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim,
    and Dodanim.  Of these were the islands of the
    nations divided in their lands, everyone after his
    language, after their families, in their nations.
     The sons of Ham were: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and
    Canaan.  The sons of Cush were: Seba, Havilah,
    Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah
    were: Sheba and Dedan.  Cush became the father
    of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the
    earth.  He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh.
    Therefore it is said, 'like Nimrod, a mighty hunter
    before Yahweh'.  The beginning of his kingdom
    was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of
    Shinar.  Out of that land he went into Assyria, and
    built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,  and Resen between Nineveh and the great city Calah.  Mizraim
    became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim,
    Naphtuhim,  Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the
    Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.
     Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,  the Jebusites, the Amorites, the
    Girgashites,  the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,
     the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were
    spread abroad.  The border of the Canaanites was
    from Sidon —as you go toward Gerar —to Gaza —
    as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and
    Zeboiim—to Lasha.  These are the sons of Ham,
    after their families, according to their languages, in
    their lands and their nations.
     Children were also born to Shem (the elder
    brother of Japheth), the father of all the children
    of Eber.  The sons of Shem were: Elam, Asshur,
    Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.  The sons of Aram
    were: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.  Arpachshad
    became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the
    father of Eber.  To Eber were born two sons.
    The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days
    the earth was divided. His brother’s name was
    Joktan.  Joktan became the father of Almodad,
    Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,  Hadoram, Uzal,
    Diklah,  Obal, Abimael, Sheba,  Ophir, Havilah,
    and Jobab. Allthese were the sons ofJoktan. Their
    dwelling extended from Mesha, as you go toward
    Sephar, the mountain of the east.  These are the
    sons of Shem, by their families, according to their
    languages, lands, and nations.
     These are the families of the sons of Noah, by
    their generations, according to their nations. The
    nations divided from these in the earth after the
    flood.
    
     The whole earth was of one language and of
    one speech.  As they traveled east,* they found
    a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.
    They said to one another, 'Come, let’s make bricks,
    and burn them thoroughly.' They had brick for
    stone, and they used tar for mortar.  They said,
    'Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower
    whose top reaches to the sky, and let’s make a name
    for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the
    surface of the whole earth.'
     Yahweh came down to see the city and the
    tower, which the children of men built.  Yahweh
    said, 'Behold, they are one people, and they all
    have one language, and this is what they begin
    to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them,
    which they intend to do.  Come, let’s go down,
    and there confuse their language, that they may
    not understand one another’s speech.'  So Yahweh
    scattered them abroad from there on the surface
    of all the earth. They stopped building the city.
    Therefore its name was called Babel, because there
    Yahweh confused the language of all the earth.
    From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the
    surface of all the earth.
     This is the history of the generations of Shem:
    Shem was one hundred years old when he became
    the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood.
     Shem lived five hundred years after he became
    the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of
    more sons and daughters.
     Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became
    the father of Shelah.  Arpachshad lived four
    hundred three years after he became the father of
    Shelah, and became the father of more sons and
    daughters.
     Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber.  Shelah lived four hundred three
    years after he became the father of Eber, and became the father of more sons and daughters.
     Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the
    father of Peleg.  Eber lived four hundred thirty
    years after he became the father of Peleg, and
    became the father of more sons and daughters.
     Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father
    of Reu.  Peleg lived two hundred nine years after
    he became the father of Reu, and became the father
    of more sons and daughters.
     Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the
    father of Serug.  Reu lived two hundred seven
    years after he became the father of Serug, and
    became the father of more sons and daughters.
     Serug lived thirty years, and became the father
    of Nahor.  Serug lived two hundred years after he

    became the father of Nahor, and became the father
    of more sons and daughters.
     Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became
    the father of Terah.  Nahor lived one hundred
    nineteen years after he became the father of Terah,
    and became the father of more sons and daughters.
     Terah lived seventy years, and became the
    father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
     Now this is the history of the generations of
    Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot.
     Haran died in the land of his birth, in Ur of
    the Chaldees, while his father Terah was still alive.
     Abram and Nahor married wives. The name of
    Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s
    wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, who was
    also the father of Iscah.  Sarai was barren. She
    had no child.  Terah took Abram his son, Lot the
    son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife. They went from Ur of
    the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They
    came to Haran and lived there.  The days of Terah
    were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran
