  The Book of
  Judges Chapters Nine through Ten:
  9
  1 Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to
  Shechem to his mother’s brothers, and spoke with
  them and with all the family of the house of his
  mother’s father, saying, 2 “Please speak in the ears
  of all the men of Shechem, ‘Is it better for you that
  all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are seventy persons,
  rule over you, or that one rule over you?’ Remember
  also that I am your bone and your flesh.”
  3 His mother’s brothers spoke of him in the ears
  of all the men of Shechem all these words. Their
  hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said,
  “He is our brother.” 4 They gave him seventy
  pieces of silver out of the house of Baal Berith, with
  which Abimelech hired vain and reckless fellows
  who followed him. 5 He went to his father’s house
  at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of
  Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone; but
  Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for
  he hid himself. 6All the men of Shechem assembled
  themselves together with all the house of Millo, and
  went and made Abimelech king by the oak of the
  pillar that was in Shechem. 7 When they told it to
  Jotham, he went and stood on the top of Mount
  Gerizim and lifted up his voice, cried out, and said
  to them, “Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that
  God may listen to you. 8 The trees set out to anoint
  a king over themselves. They said to the olive tree,
  ‘Reign over us.’
  9 “But the olive tree said to them, ‘Should I stop
  producing my oil, with which they honor God and
  man by me, and go to wave back and forth over the
  trees?’
  10 “The trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and reign
  over us.’

  * 8:26 A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.32 Troy ounces, so 1700 shekels is about 17 kilograms or 37.4 pounds.
  Judges 9:11 166 Judges 9:49

  11 “But the fig tree said to them, ‘Should I leave
  my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave
  back and forth over the trees?’
  12 “The trees said to the vine, ‘Come and reign
  over us.’
  13 “The vine said to them, ‘Should I leave my new
  wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave
  back and forth over the trees?’
  14 “Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘Come
  and reign over us.’
  15 “The bramble said to the trees, ‘If in truth you
  anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge
  in my shade; and if not, let fire come out of the
  bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’
  16 “Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and
  righteously, in that you have made Abimelech king,
  and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his
  house, and have done to him according to the
  deserving of his hands 17 (for my father fought for
  you, risked his life, and delivered you out of the
  hand of Midian; 18 and you have risen up against
  my father’s house today and have slain his sons,
  seventy persons, on one stone, and have made
  Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over
  the men of Shechem, because he is your brother);
  19 if you then have dealt truly and righteously with
  Jerubbaal and with his house today, then rejoice in
  Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you; 20 but if
  not, let fire come out from Abimelech and devour
  the men of Shechem and the house of Millo; and let
  fire come out from the men of Shechem and from
  the house of Millo and devour Abimelech.”
  21 Jotham ran away and fled, and went to Beer*
  and lived there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
  22 Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.
  23 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech
  and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem
  dealt treacherously with Abimelech, 24 that the
  violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal
  might come, and that their blood might be laid on
  Abimelech their brother who killed them, and on
  the men of Shechem who strengthened his hands
  to kill his brothers. 25 The men of Shechem set an
  ambush for him on the tops of the mountains, and
  they robbed all who came along that way by them;
  and Abimelech was told about it.
  26 Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers
  and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem
  put their trust in him. 27 They went out into the
  field, harvested their vineyards, trod the grapes,
  celebrated, and went into the house of their god
  and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech. 28 Gaal
  the son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is
  Shechem,that we should serve him? Isn’t he the son
  of Jerubbaal? Isn’t Zebul his officer? Serve the men
  of Hamor the father of Shechem, but why should we
  serve him? 29 I wish that this people were under my
  hand! Then I would remove Abimelech.” He said to
  Abimelech, “Increase your army and come out!”
  30 When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the
  words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger burned.
  31He sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying,
  “Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have
  come to Shechem; and behold, they incite the city
  against you. 32 Now therefore, go up by night, you
  and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in
  the field. 33 It shall be that in the morning, as soon
  as the sun is up, you shall rise early and rush on the
  city. Behold, when he and the people who are with
  him come out against you, then may you do to them
  as you shall find occasion.”
  34 Abimelech rose up, and all the people who
  were with him, by night, and they laid wait against
  Shechem in four companies. 35 Gaal the son of Ebed
  went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of
  the city. Abimelech rose up, and the people who
  were with him, from the ambush.
  36 When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul,
  “Behold, people are coming down from the tops of
  the mountains.”
  Zebul said to him, “You see the shadows of the
  mountains as if they were men.”
  37 Gaal spoke again and said, “Behold, people
  are coming down by the middle of the land, and
  one company comes by the way of the oak of
  Meonenim.”
  38 Then Zebul said to him, “Now where is your
  mouth, that you said, ‘Who is Abimelech, that we
  should serve him?’ Isn’t this the people that you
  have despised? Please go out now and fight with
  them.”
  39 Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and
  fought with Abimelech. 40 Abimelech chased him,
  and he fled before him, and many fell wounded,
  even to the entrance of the gate. 41 Abimelech
  lived at Arumah; and Zebul drove out Gaal and his
  brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
  42 On the next day, the people went out into the
  field; and they told Abimelech. 43 He took the
  people and divided them into three companies, and
  laid wait in the field; and he looked, and behold,
  the people came out of the city. So, he rose up
  against them and struck them. 44Abimelech and the
  companies that were with him rushed forward and
  stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and the
  two companies rushed on all who were in the field
  and struck them. 45 Abimelech fought against the
  city all that day; and he took the city and killed the
  people in it. He beat down the city and sowed it with
  salt.
  46 When all the men of the tower of Shechem
  heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the
  house of Elberith. 47 Abimelech was told that all
  the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered
  together. 48 Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon,
  he and all the people who were with him; and
  Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a
  bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on
  his shoulder. Then he said to the people who were
  with him, “What you have seen me do, make haste,
  and do as I have done!” 49 All the people likewise
  each cut down his bough, followed Abimelech, and
  put them at the base of the stronghold, and set
  the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the
  * 9:21 “Beer” is Hebrew for “well”, i.e., a village named for its well.
  Judges 9:50 167 Judges 11:15
  people of the tower of Shechem died also, about a
  thousand men and women. 50Then Abimelech went
  to Thebez and encamped against Thebez, and took
  it. 51 But there was a strong tower within the city,
  and all the men and women of the city fled there,
  and shut themselves in, and went up to the roof
  of the tower. 52 Abimelech came to the tower and
  fought against it, and came near to the door of the
  tower to burn it with fire. 53 A certain woman cast
  an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, and broke
  his skull.
  54 Then he called hastily to the young man, his
  armor bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword
  and kill me, that men not say of me, ‘A woman killed
  him.’ His young man thrust him through, and he
  died.”
  55When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was
  dead, they each departed to his place. 56 Thus God
  repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to
  his father in killing his seventy brothers; 57 and God
  repaid all the wickedness of the men of Shechem
  on their heads; and the curse of Jotham the son of
  Jerubbaal came on them.
  10
  1 After Abimelech, Tola the son of Puah, the son
  of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to save Israel. He
  lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. 2 He
  judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was
  buried in Shamir.
  3 After him Jair, the Gileadite, arose. He judged
  Israel twenty-two years. 4 He had thirty sons who
  rode on thirty donkey colts. They had thirty cities,
  which are called Havvoth Jair to this day, which are
  in the land of Gilead. 5 Jair died, and was buried in
  Kamon.
  6 The children of Israel again did that which was
  evil in Yahweh’s sight, and served the Baals, the
  Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the
  gods of Moab, the gods of the children of Ammon,
  and the gods of the Philistines. They abandoned
  Yahweh, and didn’t serve him. 7 Yahweh’s anger
  burned against Israel, and he sold them into the
  hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the
  children of Ammon. 8 They troubled and oppressed
  the children of Israel that year. For eighteen years
  they oppressed all the children of Israel that were
  beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites,
  which is in Gilead. 9 The children of Ammon
  passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah,
  and against Benjamin, and against the house of
  Ephraim, so that Israel was very distressed. 10 The
  children of Israel cried to Yahweh,saying, “We have
  sinned against you, even because we have forsaken
  our God, and have served the Baals.”
  11 Yahweh said to the children of Israel, “Didn’t
  I save you from the Egyptians, and from the
  Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from
  the Philistines? 12 The Sidonians also, and the
  Amalekites, and the Maonites, oppressed you; and
  you cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand.
  13 Yet you have forsaken me and served other gods.
  Therefore I will save you no more. 14 Go and cry to
  the gods which you have chosen. Let them save you
  in the time of your distress!”
  15The children of Israel said to Yahweh, “We have
  sinned! Do to us whatever seems good to you; only
  deliver us, please, today.” 16 They put away the
  foreign gods from among them and served Yahweh;
  and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
  17 Then the children of Ammon were gathered
  together and encamped in Gilead. The children
  of Israel assembled themselves together and encamped in Mizpah. 18 The people, the princes of
  Gilead, said to one another, “Who is the man who
  will begin to fight against the children of Ammon?
  He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”

  The First Book of Samuel, Chapters One through Two:

  1 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim
  Zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, and his
  name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son
  of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an
  Ephraimite. 2 He had two wives. The name of one
  was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah.
  Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 3 This man went up out of his city from year
  to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh* of
  Armies in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and
  Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there. 4 When
  the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and
  her daughters; 5 but he gave a double portion to
  Hannah, for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut
  up her womb. 6 Her rival provoked her severely, to
  irritate her, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.
  7 So year by year, when she went up to Yahweh’s
  house, her rival provoked her. Therefore she wept,
  and didn’t eat. 8 Elkanah her husband said to her,
  “Hannah, why do you weep? Why don’t you eat?
  Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you
  than ten sons?”
  9SoHannah rose up after they had finished eating
  and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was
  sitting on his seat by the doorpost of Yahweh’s
  temple. 10 She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed
  to Yahweh, weeping bitterly. 11 She vowed a vow,
  and said, “Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed look
  at the affliction of your servant and remember me,
  and not forget your servant, but will give to your
  servant a boy, then I will give him to Yahweh all the
  days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head.”
  12 As she continued praying before Yahweh, Eli
  saw her mouth. 13 Now Hannah spoke in her heart.
  Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard.
  Therefore Eli thought she was drunk. 14 Eli said to
  her, “How long will you be drunk? Get rid of your
  wine!”
  15Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman
  of a sorrowful spirit. I have not been drinking
  wine or strong drink, but I poured out my soul
  before Yahweh. 16 Don’t consider your servant a
  wicked woman; for I have been speaking out of the
  abundance of my complaint and my provocation.”
  17 Then Eli answered, “Go in peace; and may the
  God† of Israel grant your petition that you have
  asked of him.”
  18 She said, “Let your servant find favor in your
  sight.” So the woman went her way and ate; and
  her facial expression wasn’t sad any more.
  19 They rose up in the morning early and worshiped Yahweh, then returned and came to their
  house to Ramah. Then Elkanah knew Hannah his
  wife; and Yahweh remembered her.
  20 When the time had come, Hannah conceived,
  and bore a son; and she named him Samuel,‡ saying,
  “Because I have asked him of Yahweh.”
  21 The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up
  to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice and his vow.
  22 But Hannah didn’t go up, for she said to her
  husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then I will
  bring him, that he may appear before Yahweh, and
  stay there forever.”
  23 Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what
  seems good to you. Wait until you have weaned him;
  only may Yahweh establish his word.”
  So the woman waited and nursed her son until
  she weaned him. 24 When she had weaned him,
  she took him up with her, with three bulls, and
  one ephah§ of meal, and a container of wine, and
  brought him to Yahweh’s house in Shiloh. The child
  was young. 25 They killed the bull, and brought
  the child to Eli. 26 She said, “Oh, my lord, as your
  soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by
  you here, praying to Yahweh. 27 I prayed for this
  child, and Yahweh has given me my petition which
  I asked of him. 28 Therefore I have also given him to
  Yahweh. As long as he lives he is given to Yahweh.”
  He worshiped Yahweh there.
  2
  1 Hannah prayed, and said,
  “My heart exults in Yahweh!
  My horn is exalted in Yahweh.
  My mouth is enlarged over my enemies,
  because I rejoice in your salvation.
  2 There is no one as holy as Yahweh,
  for there is no one besides you,
  nor is there any rock like our God.
  3 “Don’t keep talking so exceedingly proudly.
  Don’t let arrogance come out of your mouth,
  for Yahweh is a God of knowledge.
  By him actions are weighed.
  4 “The bows of the mighty men are broken.
  Those who stumbled are armed with strength.
  5 Those who were full have hired themselves out for
  bread.
  Those who were hungry are satisfied.
  Yes, the barren has borne seven.
  She who has many children languishes.
  6 “Yahweh kills and makes alive.
  He brings down to Sheol* and brings up.
  7 Yahweh makes poor and makes rich.
  He brings low, he also lifts up.
  8 He raises up the poor out of the dust.
  He lifts up the needy from the dunghill
  to make them sit with princes
  and inherit the throne of glory.
  For the pillars of the earth are Yahweh’s.
  He has set the world on them.
  9 He will keep the feet of his holy ones,

  * 1:3 “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations. † 1:17 The Hebrew word rendered
  “God” is “יםִ ֑להֱֹא) “Elohim). ‡ 1:20 Samuel sounds like the Hebrew for “heard by God.” § 1:24 1 ephah is about 22 liters or about 2/3
  of a bushel * 2:6 Sheol is the place of the dead.
  1 Samuel 2:10 180 1 Samuel 3:10

  but the wicked will be put to silence in darkness;
  for no man will prevail by strength.
  10 Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to
  pieces.
  He will thunder against them in the sky.
  “Yahweh will judge the ends of the earth.
  He will give strength to his king,
  and exalt the horn of his anointed.”
  11 Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child
  served Yahweh before Eli the priest.
  12 Now the sons of Eli were wicked men. They
  didn’t know Yahweh. 13 The custom of the priests
  with the people was that when anyone offered a
  sacrifice, the priest’s servant came while the meat
  was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;
  14 and he stabbed it into the pan, or kettle, or
  cauldron, or pot. The priest took all that the fork
  brought up for himself. They did this to all the
  Israelites who came there to Shiloh. 15 Yes, before
  they burned the fat, the priest’s servant came, and
  said to the man who sacrificed, “Give meat to roast
  for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat
  from you, but raw.”
  16 If the man said to him, “Let the fat be burned
  first, and then take as much as your soul desires;”
  then he would say, “No, but you shall give it to me
  now; and if not, I will take it by force.” 17 The sin of
  the young men was very great before Yahweh; for
  the men despised Yahweh’s offering. 18 But Samuel
  ministered before Yahweh, being a child, clothed
  with a linen ephod. 19 Moreover his mother made
  him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to
  year when she came up with her husband to offer
  the yearly sacrifice. 20 Eli blessed Elkanah and his
  wife, and said, “May Yahweh give you offspring†
  from this woman for the petition which was asked
  of Yahweh.” Then they went to their own home.
  21 Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived and
  bore three sons and two daughters. The child
  Samuel grew before Yahweh.
  22 Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that
  his sons did to all Israel, and how that they slept
  with the women who served at the door of the Tent
  of Meeting. 23 He said to them, “Why do you do
  such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from
  all these people. 24 No, my sons; for it is not a
  good report that I hear! You make Yahweh’s people
  disobey. 25 If one man sins against another, God will
  judge him; but if a man sins against Yahweh, who
  will intercede for him?” Notwithstanding, they
  didn’t listen to the voice of their father, because
  Yahweh intended to kill them.
  26 The child Samuel grew on, and increased in
  favor both with Yahweh and also with men.
  27 A man of God came to Eli and said to him,
  “Yahweh says, ‘Did I reveal myself to the house of
  your father when they were in Egypt in bondage
  to Pharaoh’s house? 28 Didn’t I choose him out of
  all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up
  to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod
  before me? Didn’t I give to the house of your
  father all the offerings of the children of Israel made
  by fire? 29 Why do you kick at my sacrifice and
  at my offering, which I have commanded in my
  habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make
  yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of
  Israel my people?’ 30 “Therefore Yahweh, the God
  of Israel, says, ‘I said indeed that your house and the
  house of your father should walk before me forever.’
  But now Yahweh says, ‘Far be it from me; for those
  who honor me I will honor, and those who despise
  me will be cursed. 31 Behold,‡ the days come that I
  will cut off your arm and the arm of your father’s
  house, that there will not be an old man in your
  house. 32You will see the affliction of my habitation,
  in all the wealth which I will give Israel. There shall
  not be an old man in your house forever. 33 The
  man of yours whom I don’t cut off from my altar will
  consume your eyes§ and grieve your heart. All the
  increase of your house will die in the flower of their
  age. 34 This will be the sign to you that will come on
  your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day
  they will both die. 35 I will raise up a faithful priest
  for myself who will do according to that which is
  in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure
  house. He will walk before my anointed forever. 36 It
  will happen that everyone who is left in your house
  will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver
  and a loaf of bread, and will say, “Please put me into
  one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of
  bread.” ’ ”

  The Book of
  Judges, Chapters Eleven through Sixteen:

  11
  1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man
  of valor. He was the son of a prostitute. Gilead
  became the father of Jephthah. 2 Gilead’s wife bore
  him sons. When his wife’s sons grew up, they drove
  Jephthah out and said to him, “You will not inherit
  in our father’s house, for you are the son of another
  woman.” 3 Then Jephthah fled from his brothers
  and lived in the land of Tob. Outlaws joined up with
  Jephthah, and they went out with him.
  4 After a while, the children of Ammon made war
  against Israel. 5 When the children of Ammon made
  war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get
  Jephthah out of the land of Tob. 6 They said to
  Jephthah, “Come and be our chief,that we may fight
  with the children of Ammon.”
  7 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Didn’t you
  hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house?
  Why have you come to me now when you are in
  distress?”
  8 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Therefore we have turned again to you now, that you may
  go with us and fight with the children of Ammon.
  You will be our head over all the inhabitants of
  Gilead.”
  9 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you
  bring me home again to fight with the children of
  Ammon, and Yahweh delivers them before me, will
  I be your head?”
  10 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “Yahweh
  will be witness between us. Surely we will do what
  you say.”
  11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead,
  and the people made him head and chief over them.
  Jephthah spoke all his words before Yahweh in
  Mizpah.
  12 Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the
  children of Ammon, saying, “What do you have to
  do with me, that you have come to me to fight
  against my land?”
  13 The king of the children of Ammon answered
  the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took
  away my land when he came up out of Egypt,
  from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the
  Jordan. Now therefore restore that territory again
  peaceably.”
  14 Jephthah sent messengers again to the king
  of the children of Ammon; 15 and he said to him,
  “Jephthah says: Israel didn’t take away the land of
  Judges 11:16 168 Judges 12:10
  Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon; 16 but
  when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went
  through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came
  to Kadesh, 17 then Israel sent messengers to the
  king of Edom, saying, ‘Please let me pass through
  your land;’ but the king of Edom didn’t listen. In
  the same way, he sent to the king of Moab, but he
  refused; so Israel stayed in Kadesh. 18 Then they
  went through the wilderness, and went around the
  land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the
  eastside of the land of Moab, and they encamped on
  the other side of the Arnon; but they didn’t come
  within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the
  border of Moab. 19 Israel sent messengers to Sihon
  king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and
  Israel said to him, ‘Please let us pass through your
  land to my place.’ 20 But Sihon didn’t trust Israel
  to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all
  his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and
  fought against Israel. 21 Yahweh, the God of Israel,
  delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of
  Israel, and they struck them. So Israel possessed
  all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of
  that country. 22 They possessed all the border of
  the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok,
  and from the wilderness even to the Jordan. 23 So
  now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed
  the Amorites from before his people Israel, and
  should you possess them? 24 Won’t you possess that
  which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So
  whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from
  before us, them will we possess. 25 Now are you
  anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king
  of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he
  ever fight against them? 26 Israel lived in Heshbon
  and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all
  the cities that are along the side of the Arnon for
  three hundred years! Why didn’t you recover them
  within that time? 27 Therefore I have not sinned
  against you, but you do me wrong to war against me.
  May Yahweh the Judge be judge today between the
  children of Israel and the children of Ammon.”
  28 However, the king of the children of Ammon
  didn’t listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent
  him. 29Then Yahweh’s Spirit came on Jephthah, and
  he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed
  over Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead
  he passed over to the children of Ammon.
  30 Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, “If
  you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into
  my hand, 31 then it shall be, that whatever comes
  out of the doors of my house to meet me when
  I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it
  shall be Yahweh’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt
  offering.”
  32 So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh delivered
  them into his hand. 33 He struck them from Aroer
  until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and
  to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So
  the children of Ammon were subdued before the
  children of Israel.
  34 Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and
  behold, his daughter came out to meet him with
  tambourines and with dances. She was his only
  child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
  35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes, and said,
  “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low,
  and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have
  opened my mouth to Yahweh, and I can’t go back.”
  36 She said to him, “My father, you have opened
  your mouth to Yahweh; do to me according to that
  which has proceeded out of your mouth, because
  Yahweh has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, even on the children of Ammon.” 37 Then she
  said to her father, “Let this thing be done for me.
  Leave me alone two months, that I may depart and
  go down on the mountains, and bewail my virginity,
  I and my companions.”
  38 He said, “Go.” He sent her away for two
  months; and she departed,she and her companions,
  and mourned her virginity on the mountains. 39 At
  the end of two months, she returned to her father,
  who did with her according to his vow which he
  had vowed. She was a virgin. It became a custom
  in Israel 40 that the daughters of Israel went yearly
  to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite
  four days in a year.
  12
  1 The men of Ephraim were gathered together,
  and passed northward; and they said to Jephthah,
  “Why did you pass over to fight against the children
  of Ammon, and didn’t call us to go with you? We will
  burn your house around you with fire!”
  2 Jephthah said to them, “I and my people were at
  great strife with the children of Ammon; and when
  I called you, you didn’t save me out of their hand.
  3 When I saw that you didn’t save me, I put my life
  in my hand, and passed over against the children of
  Ammon, and Yahweh delivered them into my hand.
  Why then have you come up to me today, to fight
  against me?”
  4 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men
  of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim. The men of
  Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, “You are
  fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the middle
  of Ephraim, and in the middle of Manasseh.” 5 The
  Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the
  Ephraimites. Whenever a fugitive of Ephraim said,
  “Let me go over,” the men of Gilead said to him, “Are
  you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No;” 6 then they
  said to him, “Now say ‘Shibboleth;’ ” and he said
  “Sibboleth”; for he couldn’t manage to pronounce
  it correctly, then they seized him and killed him
  at the fords of the Jordan. At that time, forty-two
  thousand of Ephraim fell.
  7 Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah
  the Gileadite died, and was buried in the cities of
  Gilead.
  8 After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
  9 He had thirty sons. He sent his thirty daughters
  outside his clan, and he brought in thirty daughters
  from outside his clan for his sons. He judged
  Israel seven years. 10 Ibzan died, and was buried at
  Bethlehem.
  Judges 12:11 169 Judges 14:10
  11 After him, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel;
  and he judged Israel ten years. 12 Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of
  Zebulun.
  13 After him, Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 14 He had forty sons and
  thirty sons’ sons who rode on seventy donkey colts.
  He judged Israel eight years. 15 Abdon the son
  of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in
  Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country
  of the Amalekites.
  13
  1 The children of Israel again did that which was
  evil in Yahweh’s sight; and Yahweh delivered them
  into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
  2 There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family
  of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his
  wife was barren, and childless. 3 Yahweh’s angel
  appeared to the woman, and said to her, “See now,
  you are barren and childless; but you shall conceive
  and bear a son. 4 Now therefore please beware and
  drink no wine nor strong drink, and don’t eat any
  unclean thing; 5 for, behold, you shall conceive and
  give birth to a son. No razor shall come on his head,
  for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the
  womb. He shall begin to save Israel out of the hand
  of the Philistines.”
  6 Then the woman came and told her husband,
  saying, “A man of God came to me, and his face was
  like the face of the angel of God, very awesome. I
  didn’t ask him where he was from, neither did he
  tell me his name; 7 but he said to me, ‘Behold, you
  shall conceive and bear a son; and now drink no
  wine nor strong drink. Don’t eat any unclean thing,
  for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the
  womb to the day of his death.’ ”
  8 Then Manoah entreated Yahweh, and said, “Oh,
  Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent come
  again to us, and teach us what we should do to the
  child who shall be born.”
  9 God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the
  angel of God came again to the woman as she sat
  in the field; but Manoah, her husband, wasn’t with
  her. 10 The woman hurried and ran, and told her
  husband, saying to him, “Behold, the man who
  came to me that day has appeared to me.”
  11 Manoah arose and followed his wife, and came
  to the man, and said to him, “Are you the man who
  spoke to my wife?”
  He said, “I am.”
  12 Manoah said, “Now let your words happen.
  What shall the child’s way of life and mission be?”
  13 Yahweh’s angel said to Manoah, “Of all that I
  said to the woman let her beware. 14 She may not
  eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let
  her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean
  thing. Let her observe all that I commanded her.”
  15 Manoah said to Yahweh’s angel, “Please stay
  with us, that we may make a young goat ready for
  you.”
  16 Yahweh’s angel said to Manoah, “Though you
  detain me, I won’t eat your bread. If you will prepare
  a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh.” For
  Manoah didn’t know that he was Yahweh’s angel.
  17 Manoah said to Yahweh’s angel, “What is your
  name, that when your words happen, we may honor
  you?”
  18 Yahweh’s angel said to him, “Why do you ask
  about my name, since it is incomprehensible*?”
  19 So Manoah took the young goat with the meal
  offering, and offered it on the rock to Yahweh. Then
  the angel did an amazing thing as Manoah and his
  wife watched. 20For when the flame went up toward
  the sky from off the altar, Yahweh’s angel ascended
  in the flame of the altar. Manoah and his wife
  watched; and they fell on their faces to the ground.
  21 But Yahweh’s angel didn’t appear to Manoah or
  to his wife any more. Then Manoah knew that he
  was Yahweh’s angel. 22Manoah said to his wife, “We
  shall surely die, because we have seen God.”
  23 But his wife said to him, “If Yahweh were
  pleased to kill us, he wouldn’t have received a
  burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand, and
  he wouldn’t have shown us all these things, nor
  would he have told us such things as these at this
  time.” 24 The woman bore a son and named him
  Samson. The child grew, and Yahweh blessed him.
  25 Yahweh’s Spirit began to move him in Mahaneh
  Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
  14
  1 Samson went down to Timnah, and saw
  a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the
  Philistines. 2He came up, and told his father and his
  mother, saying, “I have seen a woman in Timnah of
  the daughters of the Philistines. Now therefore get
  her for me as my wife.”
  3 Then his father and his mother said to him,
  “Isn’t there a woman among your brothers’ daughters, or among all my people, that you go to take a
  wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?”
  Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she
  pleases me well.”
  4 But his father and his mother didn’t know that
  it was of Yahweh; for he sought an occasion against
  the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines
  ruled over Israel.
  5 Then Samson went down to Timnah with his
  father and his mother, and came to the vineyards
  of Timnah; and behold, a young lion roared at him.
  6 Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on him, and he
  tore him as he would have torn a young goat with
  his bare hands, but he didn’t tell his father or his
  mother what he had done. 7 He went down and
  talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson
  well. 8 After a while he returned to take her, and he
  went over to see the carcass of the lion; and behold,
  there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion,
  and honey. 9He took it into his hands, and went on,
  eating as he went. He came to his father and mother
  and gave to them, and they ate, but he didn’t tell
  them that he had taken the honey out of the lion’s
  body. 10 His father went down to the woman; and
  Samson made a feast there, for the young men used

  * 13:18 or, wonderful
  Judges 14:11 170 Judges 16:3

  to do so. 11 When they saw him, they brought thirty
  companions to be with him.
  12 Samson said to them, “Let me tell you a riddle
  now. If you can tell me the answer within the seven
  days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give
  you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of
  clothing; 13 but if you can’t tell me the answer, then
  you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty
  changes of clothing.”
  They said to him, “Tell us your riddle, that we
  may hear it.”
  14 He said to them,
  “Out of the eater came out food.
  Out of the strong came out sweetness.”
  They couldn’t in three days declare the riddle.
  15 On the seventh day, they said to Samson’s wife,
  “Entice your husband, that he may declare to us
  the riddle, lest we burn you and your father’s house
  with fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Isn’t
  that so?”
  16 Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, “You
  just hate me, and don’t love me. You’ve told a riddle
  to the children of my people, and haven’t told it to
  me.”
  He said to her, “Behold, I haven’t told my father
  or my mother, so why should I tell you?”
  17She wept before him the seven days, while their
  feast lasted; and on the seventh day, he told her,
  because she pressed him severely; and she told the
  riddle to the children of her people. 18 The men
  of the city said to him on the seventh day before
  the sun went down, “What is sweeter than honey?
  What is stronger than a lion?”
  He said to them,
  “If you hadn’t plowed with my heifer,
  you wouldn’t have found out my riddle.”
  19 Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on him, and he
  went down to Ashkelon and struck thirty men of
  them. He took their plunder, then gave the changes
  of clothing to those who declared the riddle. His
  anger burned, and he went up to his father’s house.
  20 But Samson’s wife was given to his companion,
  who had been his friend.
  15
  1 But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest,
  Samson visited his wife with a young goat. He said,
  “I will go in to my wife’s room.”
  But her father wouldn’t allow him to go in. 2 Her
  father said, “I most certainly thought that you
  utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your
  companion. Isn’t her younger sister more beautiful
  than she? Please, take her instead.”
  3 Samson said to them, “This time I will be
  blameless in the case of the Philistines when I harm
  them.” 4 Samson went and caught three hundred
  foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and
  put a torch in the middle between every two tails.
  5 When he had set the torches on fire, he let them
  go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and
  burned up both the shocks and the standing grain,
  and also the olive groves.
  6 Then the Philistines said, “Who has done this?”
  They said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the
  Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given
  her to his companion.” The Philistines came up, and
  burned her and her father with fire.
  7 Samson said to them, “If you behave like this,
  surely I will take revenge on you, and after that I
  will cease.” 8 He struck them hip and thigh with a
  great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the
  cave in Etam’s rock. 9 Then the Philistines went up,
  encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.
  10The men of Judah said, “Why have you come up
  against us?”
  They said, “We have come up to bind Samson, to
  do to him as he has done to us.”
  11 Then three thousand men of Judah went down
  to the cave in Etam’s rock, and said to Samson,
  “Don’t you know that the Philistines are rulers over
  us? What then is this that you have done to us?”
  He said to them, “As they did to me,so I have done
  to them.”
  12 They said to him, “We have come down to bind
  you, that we may deliver you into the hand of the
  Philistines.”
  Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will
  not attack me yourselves.”
  13They spoke to him,saying, “No, but we will bind
  you securely and deliver you into their hands; but
  surely we will not kill you.” They bound him with
  two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.
  14 When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted
  as they met him. Then Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on him, and the ropes that were on his arms
  became as flax that was burned with fire; and his
  bands dropped from off his hands. 15 He found a
  fresh jawbone of a donkey, put out his hand, took
  it, and struck a thousand men with it. 16 Samson
  said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on
  heaps; with the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a
  thousand men.” 17 When he had finished speaking,
  he threw the jawbone out of his hand; and that place
  was called Ramath Lehi.*
  18 He was very thirsty, and called on Yahweh and
  said, “You have given this great deliverance by the
  hand of your servant; and now shall I die of thirst,
  and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”
  19 But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi,
  and water came out of it. When he had drunk, his
  spirit came again, and he revived. Therefore its
  name was called EnHakkore, which isin Lehi,to this
  day. 20 He judged Israel twenty years in the days of
  the Philistines.
  16
  1 Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a prostitute, and went in to her. 2 The Gazites were told,
  “Samson is here!” They surrounded him and laid
  wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and
  were quiet all the night,saying, “Wait until morning
  light; then we will kill him.” 3 Samson lay until
  midnight, then arose at midnight and took hold of
  the doors of the gate of the city, with the two posts,
  and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on
  * 15:17 “Ramath” means “hill” and “Lehi” means “jawbone”.
  Judges 16:4 171 Judges 17:4
  his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the
  mountain that is before Hebron.
  4 It came to pass afterward that he loved a woman
  in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
  5 The lords of the Philistines came up to her and
  said to her, “Entice him, and see in which his great
  strength lies, and by what means we may prevail
  against him, that we may bind him to afflict him;
  and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of
  silver.”
  6 Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where
  your great strength lies, and what you might be
  bound to afflict you.”
  7 Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven
  green cords that were never dried, then shall I
  become weak, and be as another man.”
  8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to
  her seven green cords which had not been dried,
  and she bound him with them. 9 Now she had an
  ambush waiting in the inner room. She said to him,
  “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” He broke the
  cords as a flax thread is broken when it touches the
  fire. So his strength was not known.
  10 Delilah said to Samson, “Behold, you have
  mocked me, and told me lies. Now please tell me
  how you might be bound.”
  11 He said to her, “If they only bind me with new
  ropes with which no work has been done, then shall
  I become weak, and be as another man.”
  12 So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with
  them, then said to him, “The Philistines are on you,
  Samson!” The ambush was waiting in the inner
  room. He broke them off his arms like a thread.
  13 Delilah said to Samson, “Until now, you have
  mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what you
  might be bound.”
  He said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of
  my head with the fabric on the loom.”
  14 She fastened it with the pin, and said to him,
  “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” He awakened
  out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of the
  beam and the fabric.
  15 She said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’
  when your heart is not with me? You have mocked
  me these three times, and have not told me where
  your great strength lies.”
  16When she pressed him daily with her words and
  urged him, his soul was troubled to death. 17He told
  her all his heart and said to her, “No razor has ever
  come on my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God
  from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my
  strength will go from me and I will become weak,
  and be like any other man.”
  18 When Delilah saw that he had told her all
  his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the
  Philistines, saying, “Come up this once, for he
  has told me all his heart.” Then the lords of the
  Philistines came up to her and brought the money
  in their hand. 19 She made him sleep on her knees;
  and she called for a man and shaved off the seven
  locks of his head; and she began to afflict him,
  and his strength went from him. 20 She said, “The
  Philistines are upon you, Samson!”
  He awoke out of his sleep, and said, “I will go out
  as at other times, and shake myself free.” But he
  didn’t know that Yahweh had departed from him.
  21 The Philistines laid hold on him and put out his
  eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza and bound
  him with fetters of bronze; and he ground at the mill
  in the prison. 22However, the hair of his head began
  to grow again after he was shaved.
  23 The lords of the Philistines gathered together
  to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and
  to rejoice; for they said, “Our god has delivered
  Samson our enemy into our hand.” 24 When the
  people saw him, they praised their god; for they
  said, “Our god has delivered our enemy and the
  destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us,
  into our hand.”
  25 When their hearts were merry, they said, “Call
  for Samson, that he may entertain us.” They called
  for Samson out of the prison; and he performed
  before them. They set him between the pillars;
  26 and Samson said to the boy who held him by the
  hand, “Allow me to feel the pillars on which the
  house rests, that I may lean on them.” 27 Now the
  house was full of men and women; and all the lords
  of the Philistines were there; and there were on the
  roof about three thousand men and women, who
  saw while Samson performed. 28 Samson called to
  Yahweh, and said, “Lord Yahweh, remember me,
  please, and strengthen me, please, only this once,
  God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines
  for my two eyes.” 29 Samson took hold of the two
  middle pillars on which the house rested and leaned
  on them, the one with his right hand and the other
  with his left. 30 Samson said, “Let me die with the
  Philistines!” He bowed himself with all his might;
  and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people
  who were in it. So the dead that he killed at his
  death were more than those who he killed in hislife.
  31Then his brothers and all the house of his father
  came down and took him, and brought him up and
  buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial
  site of Manoah his father. He judged Israel twenty
  years.
